The closures mark the conclusion of a stop-start approach to atomic energy and a victory for the countryâ€™s vociferous anti-nuclear movement. The facilities shutting are in Emsland, in the northern state of Lower Saxony, the Isar 2 site in Bavaria, and Neckarwestheim, in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in the south-west. The shutdowns leave a conundrum for energy policymakers attempting to balance growing electricity demand in one of Europeâ€™s industrial superpowers and efforts to decarbonise, against the backdrop of uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. Germany last year delayed the closure of the three sites â€“ which provided about 6.5% of the countryâ€™s electricity in 2022 â€“ after Russia reduced European gas supplies, triggering concerns about a shortage of energy over the winter. The country began phasing out nuclear power more than two decades ago amid a long-fought campaign against the technology, but, in 2010 Angela Merkel, then chancellor, announced an extension to the life of the countryâ€™s 17 nuclear plants until 2036 at the latest. This policy was swiftly reversed the following year after an earthquake and tsunami caused the meltdown of reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, triggering fresh anti-nuclear protests and political resolve to exit the technology. Nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island in the US in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 had already entrenched the push against nuclear in Germany, which had begun earlier in the 1970s.

You could go out there, and if your uncle or your dad worked there, you probably were going to get a job,â€? Voll said. He also remains a supporter of nuclear energy and has never feared the plant. But after the leaks and the public meetings, he said his trust in Xcel â€œis way downâ€?. Xcel sent the pipe that leaked to an independent group, where experts are studying it to determine what caused it to fail, Coss, the Xcel spokesperson stated. â€œThe results will help us understand whether there are other potential steps we need to take at the plant,â€? he wrote. The company also will conduct a â€œthorough inspectionâ€? of the plant while itâ€™s offline for refueling this month, Coss added. Xcel â€œwill work to maintainâ€? the communityâ€™s trust, Coss wrote, â€œby thoroughly cleaning up the leaked tritium and providing prompt updates if anything about the situation changesâ€?.","charCount":"5377","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/eric-berger\">Eric Berger</a>","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T17:18:08Z","webTitle":"UN nuclear watchdog says fighting near Ukraine power plant is â€˜intensifyingâ€™ ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","fields":{"headline":"UN nuclear watchdog says fighting near Ukraine power plant is â€˜intensifyingâ€™ ","standfirst":"<p>IAEA director general Rafael Grossi warns that hostilities around Zaporizhzhia risk â€˜major nuclear accident which will spare no oneâ€™</p>","trailText":"IAEA director general Rafael Grossi warns that hostilities around Zaporizhzhia risk â€˜major nuclear accident which will spare no oneâ€™","byline":"Julian Borger, world affairs editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a20812fed6793291b25661f12f008018b539939d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a20812fed6793291b25661f12f008018b539939d/0_375_6192_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fighting continues around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, even as IAEA director general Rafael Grossi warned that  â€˜every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attackedâ€™\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fighting continues around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, even as IAEA director general Rafael Grossi warned that  â€˜every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attackedâ€™.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine amid an escalation in the fighting around it.</p> <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: â€œIt is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked.</p> <p>â€œI think itâ€™s no secret that there is a significant increase in the number of troops in the region, and there is open talk about offensive and counter offensives,â€? he added.</p> <p>The plant is on the south bank of the Dnieper river, which forms the frontline at a time when Russian forces have attempted to conduct a series of offensives and Ukraine is widely expected to launch a counter-offensive in the coming months.</p> <p>Grossi was accompanying three IAEA inspectors who will replace an outgoing monitoring team and are due to stay at the site for the next two months, the seventh team to take up the rotating role since the agencyâ€™s presence was accepted by Kyiv and Moscow.</p> <p>The director general is also in Zaporizhzhia to continue efforts to negotiate protections for the plant, which would require the agreement of Ukrainian and Russian forces not to fire in or out of the area.</p> <p>â€œThere have been different concepts that we have been working on.

Ted Oâ€™Brien, the shadow minister for climate change and energy, issued a statement on Friday saying he was â€œlaunching a grassroots community engagement programâ€? under the banner â€œTime to Talk Nuclearâ€?. He urged Australians to â€œjoin the conversationâ€? by completing a short survey on the website, with the first question being: â€œWhat do you think could be the benefits of nuclear energy in Australia?â€? Guardian Australia can reveal the web domain was registered by Helixos Pty Ltd, a Sydney-based consulting company whose projects include â€œsupporting the commercialisation of new nuclear energy technologyâ€?. Helixos lists the US company NuScale Power as one of its clients. Helixos says on its own website that NuScale Power â€œis reinventing nuclear energy and Helixos is helping them bring it to marketâ€?. It adds: â€œHelixos also provides training for employees to become technology ambassadors and engage with stakeholders and the public.â€? A search of domain records for Oâ€™Brienâ€™s website shows the contact name for the domain registration is Lenka Kollar, a nuclear engineer who co-founded Helixos in 2020. She previously held the role of director of strategy and external relations for NuScale Power. In that previous role, Kollar was â€œworking to bring NuScaleâ€™s small modular reactor to market through business plan development and clean energy outreachâ€?, according to a profile published in 2017. Kollar addressed a Global Uranium Conference in Adelaide last month on the topic â€œreaching net zero with nuclear energyâ€?.

As part of designing the website it also registered the domain name. A source close to the matter said Oâ€™Brienâ€™s team had sought out Helixos, believing it was ideal for the job because of its familiarity with the topic of nuclear energy. But the source said Oâ€™Brien had come up with the idea of the survey and the questions, and paid for the work himself. In a written response, Oâ€™Brien said the purpose of the survey and the use of collected data had â€œall been openly and accurately communicatedâ€?. â€œIâ€™m personally paying for the grassroots community campaign â€˜Time to Talk Nuclearâ€™ out of my own back pocket because I think itâ€™s an important conversation to have with the Australian people,â€?

The vice-president of marketing and communications for NuScale Power, Diane Hughes, said: â€œHelixos does in fact provide services for NuScale Power. â€œHowever, outside of providing an example image of our small modular reactor technology, NuScale does not have any involvement in the website, survey, nor outreach on advanced nuclear technologies being conducted by Mr Oâ€™Brien.â€? Helixos and Kollar were also contacted for comment. Helixos describes itself as a business that works â€œat the intersection of strategy consulting and technical advisory, specialising in cleantech commercialisationâ€? and says it acts in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Helixosâ€™s projects are listed openly on its own website. It works with the Energy Policy Institute of Australia â€œon editing public policy papers to promote progressive, technology-inclusive energy policyâ€?, including one focusing on â€œthe ability of small modular reactors (SMRs) to support a â€˜just transitionâ€™ for coal communities in Australiaâ€?. Helixos states it worked with SMR Nuclear Technology Pty Ltd â€œto develop a proactive stakeholder engagement strategyâ€? to â€œhelp achieve the main goal of having nuclear energy considered as part of Australiaâ€™s future energy mixâ€?. Robert Pritchard, who is both chair of SMR Nuclear Technology and executive director of the Energy Policy Institute of Australia, declined to comment. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said in his budget reply speech that the Coalition wanted â€œan intelligent conversation on the role that these new-age nuclear technologies might or might not be able to playâ€? in Australia. Announcing the â€œgrassroots community engagement programâ€? on Friday, Oâ€™Brien said the starting point would be â€œan online survey that will open a two-way conversation with the Australian public about the benefits and concerns of advanced nuclear technology becoming part of Australiaâ€™s future energy mixâ€?. â€œOther countries are reducing their emissions while keeping costs down and their network secure with nuclear energy,â€?

The grant is intended to ensure that plants like Diablo Canyon can stay afloat. â€œWe can protect these facilities and the communities they serve,â€? Granholm said.

The plantâ€™s supporters may have had its remote location, on a rugged peninsula in Japanâ€™s north-east, in mind when they campaigned to bring nuclear power â€“ and the promise of subsidies â€“ to the town more than 40 years ago. Despite its seclusion, the plant is now in the political spotlight, as Japan prepares to again put its faith in nuclear power, more than a decade after the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi. In a sweeping change to the countryâ€™s energy policy, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has announced plans to build next-generation reactors and restart those left idle after the 2011 triple meltdown, in an attempt to end Japanâ€™s dependence on imported fossil fuels and help meet its net zero target by 2050. Kishidaâ€™s â€œgreen transformationâ€?, which could include extending the lifespan of existing reactors beyond the current maximum of 60 years, underlines Japanâ€™s struggle to secure an affordable energy supply as a result of the war in Ukraine and a power crunch that has triggered warnings of potential blackouts in Tokyo during this summerâ€™s heatwave. Most of Japanâ€™s nuclear power plants have remained offline since the Fukushima meltdown, and previous governments indicated they would not build new reactors or replace ageing ones, fearing a backlash from a shaken and sceptical public. Japan plans for nuclear to account for 20-22% of its electricity supply in 2030, compared with about a third before Fukushima. In 2020 the figure was less than 5%. Just 10 nuclear reactors among more than 30 have been restarted since the post-Fukushima introduction of stricter safety standards. If Kishida gets his way though, seven additional reactors will be restarted after next summer, including the No. 2 unit at Onagawa, which sustained structural damage from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami but escaped a catastrophic meltdown despite being the closest atomic plant to the quakeâ€™s epicentre. â€˜A threat to the safety of local peopleâ€™ The restart has been approved by Japanâ€™s nuclear watchdog and given â€œlocal consentâ€? by Yoshihiro Murai, the governor of Miyagi â€“ the prefecture where Onagawa is located. But many residents argue that contingency plans for potential accidents would put lives at risk. â€œThe evacuation plans wonâ€™t work â€¦ they are a threat to the safety of local people,â€? says Masami Hino, one of 17 residents living within 30km of the plant who last year launched a legal action to block the restart, now scheduled for early 2024. In the event of a serious accident, 1,000 residents living within 5km of the plant would leave immediately, while 190,000 people within a 30km radius would evacuate in stages, according to the official blueprint. â€œThere will be huge traffic jams, and we wonâ€™t be able to escape,â€? says Hino, who cited one expert simulation â€“ dismissed by local authorities â€“ showing that it could take up to five days for everyone to make it to safety. â€œIf there is an accident it is ridiculous to think that people will leave in an orderly way,â€? he said. â€œThey will just get out as quickly as they can and then get stuck for days without food, water or access to toilets.â€? Critics say an evacuation in the wake of an accident would clog the areaâ€™s narrow, winding roads, leaving people at risk of exposure to radiation. Most would leave in private cars, but others would have to board buses. The plantâ€™s operator, Tohoku Electric Power, and local authorities would provide almost 1,000 staff to screen people for radiation exposure before directing them to temporary shelters. â€œHow can Tohoku Electric and the prefecture guarantee that an evacuation would go smoothly after something like a major earthquake? Itâ€™s impossible,â€? says Mikiko Abe, an independent member of the Onagawa town assembly who has spent 40 years campaigning for the plantâ€™s closure. â€œInstead of planning for an evacuation, wouldnâ€™t it be better to live safely in a place where thereâ€™s no need to even think about fleeing our homes?â€? Kishidaâ€™s response to energy insecurity and the climate crisis has won the backing of Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), who said restarting more nuclear plants in Japan â€“ one of the worldâ€™s biggest consumers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) â€“ would free up more LNG and help ease Europeâ€™s energy supply fears during the winter. Domestic opposition to a bigger role for nuclear in the energy mix appears to be weakening. A poll by the Nikkei business paper in June found that 53% of respondents agreed with putting reactors back into service if their safety could be assured â€“ the first time that support for restarts had exceeded opposition since the 2011 triple disaster. While pro-nuclear members of the Miyagi prefectural assembly have helped resist calls for a referendum, a poll in April by the local Kahoku Shinpo newspaper found that 56% of residents were â€œstronglyâ€? or â€œsomewhatâ€? opposed the restart. â€œAll of Japanâ€™s nuclear power plants are on the coast â€¦ and this is a country that has earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanoes,â€? says Tsuyoshi Suda, a member of local anti-nuclear group Kaze no Kai, as he looked at the plant â€“ complete with a newly built 29-metre high seawall â€“ from a nearby beach. â€œFor Japan to keep putting its faith in nuclear power plants is like a form of self-destruction.â€?","charCount":"5460","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/justinmccurry\">Justin McCurry</a> in Onagawa","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-observer-view-on-britain-urgent-build-more-nuclear-power-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T06:30:12Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Britainâ€™s urgent need to commit to nuclear power | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-observer-view-on-britain-urgent-build-more-nuclear-power-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-observer-view-on-britain-urgent-build-more-nuclear-power-plants","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Britainâ€™s urgent need to commit to nuclear power","standfirst":"The government denied wavering over the future of Sizewell C, but it needs to come up with an energy plan â€“ and quickly","trailText":"The government denied wavering over the future of Sizewell C, but it needs to come up with an energy plan â€“ and quickly","byline":"Observer editorial","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"384dc783156645c100c49e93faf01248dd3fad98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/384dc783156645c100c49e93faf01248dd3fad98/0_16_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sizewell B nuclear power station: Sizewell C is due to be built nearby at the Suffolk site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sizewell B nuclear power station: Sizewell C is due to be built nearby at the Suffolk site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Radburn/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>For a moment last week, our cash-strapped government seemed ready to abandon a project that many experts believe is central to our plans of achieving energy independence and net zero emissions.

Very different values are placed on human life, depending on the specific risk. The level of air pollutants considered acceptable by the World Health Organization is already dangerous, increasing mortality by 2%. In contrast, the level of radioactivity considered acceptable is 100-500 times below levels that cause a similar increase in mortality. What this means is that a life lost to air pollution is valued 100- to 500-fold lower than a life lost to exposure to radioactivity. It is partly because of this difference, and the resulting regulatory regimes, that coal-fired power stations are much cheaper to build than nuclear power stations, even though they are at least 500 times more dangerous. It is only because of concerns about the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change that countries are now considering alternatives to coal, including nuclear power. If we had, from the outset, valued lives lost to air pollution the same as lives lost to radioactivity, we would have been building nuclear power plants rather than coal-fired power plants for the past 40 years. Many millions of lives would have been saved, and the climate emergency might have been avoided. Anton van der Merwe Oxford â€¢ Your article about wood burning stoves seems to be yet another example of individuals being made to feel responsible for the worldâ€™s environmental woes while governments and business pay little more than lip service to such issues. The wood that I burn is collected within a five-mile radius of my home, and I would guess that most wood burned domestically is similarly local. By contrast, Drax power station, about 15 miles from me, burns millions of tons of woodchips imported from forests in North America and elsewhere, brought here in huge, polluting tankers. But because it is called â€œbiomassâ€?, it attracts billions of pounds in government subsidies. While I am concerned about pollution, I will be continuing to burn biomass, without subsidy, for the foreseeable future.

Currently only 28 of 56 plants in France are on the grid, due in part to the shortage of cooling water linked to this summerâ€™s drought, meaning Germany has had to supply its neighbour with electricity.","charCount":"4571","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/kateconnolly\">Kate Connolly</a>  in Berlin"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/27/kim-jong-un-daughter-inspects-another-icbm-as-leader-hails-north-koreas-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T05:38:03Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un daughter inspects another ICBM as leader hails North Koreaâ€™s nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/27/kim-jong-un-daughter-inspects-another-icbm-as-leader-hails-north-koreas-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/27/kim-jong-un-daughter-inspects-another-icbm-as-leader-hails-north-koreas-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-un daughter inspects another ICBM as leader hails North Koreaâ€™s nuclear power","standfirst":"<p>Kim is joined by young daughter on inspection of his forces, increasing speculation that he is paving way for next generation of Kim dynasty</p>","trailText":"Kim is joined by young daughter on inspection of his forces, increasing speculation that he is paving way for next generation of Kim dynasty","byline":"Staff and agencies","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a387628b412384fa7fde8880369a2e27d72f0a2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a387628b412384fa7fde8880369a2e27d72f0a2a/0_0_2126_1413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un poses with his daughter and soldiers in an image released on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">North Korean leader Kim Jong-un poses with his daughter and soldiers in an image released on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: æœ?é®®é€šä¿¡ç¤¾/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Kim Jong-un has said North Korea intends to have the worldâ€™s most powerful nuclear force as the leader was again pictured with his daughter while inspecting troops and an intercontinental ballistic missile.</p> <p>North Koreaâ€™s â€œultimate goal is to possess the worldâ€™s most powerful strategic force, the absolute force unprecedented in the centuryâ€?, Kim said in an order promoting dozens of military officers involved in the launch last weekend of a new ballistic missile, state media reported on Sunday.</p> <p>He described the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) as the â€œworldâ€™s strongest strategic weaponâ€? and said it demonstrated North Koreaâ€™s resolve and ability to eventually build the worldâ€™s strongest army, which would reliably protect the dignity and sovereignty of the state and the people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/23/symbolism-or-succession-clues-kim-jong-uns-daughter-debut-sparks-speculation-over-north-koreas-future\">Symbolism or succession clues?

North Koreaâ€™s â€œultimate goal is to possess the worldâ€™s most powerful strategic force, the absolute force unprecedented in the centuryâ€?, Kim said in an order promoting dozens of military officers involved in the launch last weekend of a new ballistic missile, state media reported on Sunday. He described the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) as the â€œworldâ€™s strongest strategic weaponâ€? and said it demonstrated North Koreaâ€™s resolve and ability to eventually build the worldâ€™s strongest army, which would reliably protect the dignity and sovereignty of the state and the people. State media also showed Kim being accompanied on a military review by his daughter, whose existence had never been publicly confirmed before last weekendâ€™s Hwasong-17 test. Ju Ae is estimated to be about 12 or 13 years of age, which means that in about four to five years she will be preparing to attend university or go into military service, Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Centre in Washington, said last week. State media news agency KCNA described her as Kimâ€™s â€œmost belovedâ€? or â€œpreciousâ€? child, a more honorific title than her previous description of Kimâ€™s â€œbelovedâ€? child on its dispatch the previous week. Her second appearance will raise the prospect that leadership of the totalitarian state could pass to a fourth generation of Kims. Kim is believed to have as many as three children â€“ two girls and a boy, experts said. Some observers believed one of those children was seen in footage of celebrations for a national holiday in September. In Sundayâ€™s report, Kim was also quoted as saying North Korean scientists had made a â€œwonderful leap forward in the development of the technology of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic missilesâ€? and were expected to expand and strengthen the countryâ€™s nuclear deterrent at an extraordinarily rapid pace. Kim was pictured in photos posing with scientists, engineers and military officials involved in the test. According to state media, those workers pledged to defend the â€œabsolute authorityâ€? of the party and Kim, and vowed that â€œour missiles will fly vigorously only in the direction indicatedâ€? by Kim. Capable of reaching the US mainland, the launch of the Hwasong-17 on 19 November prompted the US to call for a United Nations security council presidential statement to hold North Korea accountable for its missile tests, which are banned by security council resolutions. North Koreaâ€™s powerful standing committee of the Supreme Peopleâ€™s Assembly awarded the Hwasong-17 missile the title of â€œDPRK hero and gold star medal and order of national flag 1st classâ€?, state news agency KCNA reported in another statement, using the initials of the countryâ€™s official name, Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea. â€œ[The missile] clearly proved before the world that the DPRK is a full-fledged nuclear power capable of standing against the nuclear supremacy of the US imperialists and fully demonstrated its might as the most powerful ICBM state,â€?

So far, so typical for a rural community in the German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. However, this settlement of 4,200 residents has one defining characteristic: it is located right next to one of Germanyâ€™s three remaining nuclear power stations. The challenges facing this picturesque village illustrate how the energy crisis is affecting Europeâ€™s largest economy, as Russiaâ€™s weaponisation of the gas supply has complicated Germanyâ€™s planned transition away from nuclear. On a crisp, clear autumn day, clouds of steam rise from the Neckarwestheim nuclear plantâ€™s pressurised water reactor, pale against the hill at whose feet it stands. For those prepared to live with a reactor as a neighbour, its arrival in the mid-70s heralded a golden age. The siteâ€™s first reactor stopped producing power in 2011, while the second has been operational since 1989. â€œEveryoneâ€™s dreams came true,â€? says Jochen Winkler, the mayor of Neckarwestheim, from his office overlooking the main square of the village, which will celebrate its 900th birthday in 2023. In more recent times, the village has flourished; its population has doubled over the four decades the power station has been there. Winkler reels off a list of the amenities enjoyed by residents, from a sports hall and a cultural centre to subsidised childcare and even, once upon a time, â€œwelcome moneyâ€? paid to the parents of newborns, all thanks to local business taxes collected from the power station. Its owner is EnBW â€“ a majority state-owned and publicly traded energy company, whose name stands for Energy Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. â€œWe had an income equivalent to that of communities which are three or four times our size,â€? says Winkler. But this is coming to an end, and Neckarwestheim II is living on borrowed time, limiting the local authorityâ€™s largesse. Along with Germanyâ€™s two other remaining nuclear power stations, it was supposed to be turned off by the end of the year, undergoing the final stage of an 11-year phase-out process initiated by Angela Merkelâ€™s government after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. However, the urgent need to ensure winter energy supply as Russia throttled flows of gas into Europe led the federal government in Berlin to grant a stay of execution.

Yevgeny Prigozhin made the comment in a recorded message posted on his Telegram channel on Sunday morning. Six members of Ukraineâ€™s State Emergency Service have been killed by shelling in the southern region of Kherson, officials have said. According to the office of Ukraineâ€™s prosecutor general, the Russian military dropped the shells from a drone near a populated area on Saturday. Russiaâ€™s former president Dmitry Medvedev has threatened anyone convicted of carrying out Saturdayâ€™s attack on the nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin with life in prison. Writing on Telegram, Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russiaâ€™s security council, said that any suspects, â€œlike other criminals, will be tried for the attack and sentenced to long prison termsâ€?. The Russian nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin, who was injured in a car explosion on Saturday, has been brought out of a medically induced coma, according to local officials. Air raid alerts sounded for several hours overnight into early Sunday over roughly two-thirds of Ukraine. Officials said air defence systems shot down a number of drones, including one over Kyivâ€™s airspace. Five people were injured in a strike on the city of Balaklia, local authorities said. Oleg Synegubov, the governor of eastern Kharkiv region, said on Telegram that a missile landed near a car park on Sunday. Russia has claimed that its defence systems shot down 22 Ukrainian drones over the Black Sea overnight on Saturday. Writing on Telegram, the ministry of defence said that â€œduring the night, 22 Ukrainian strike unmanned aerial vehicles were detected over the Black Sea by means of air defence.â€? Ukraine launched more than 10 drones on the Crimean peninsula overnight, including three on the port of Sevastopol, a Russian-installed official said early on Sunday. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said the situation in the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was becoming â€œincreasingly unpredictable and potentially dangerousâ€?. Sixteen settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were hit by a total of 75 strikes over the past day, according to the local military administration. A 72-year-old woman was killed and two people were injured by shelling in the southern Dnipro region, local officials said. The number of Russian soldiers killed or wounded since the start of the war stands at 193,430, according to latest estimates from the Ukrainian military.

Dutton told the Minerals Council on Wednesday that Australia needs a â€œfrank debateâ€? about nuclear energy, suggesting that it has a â€œwonderful opportunity to add valueâ€? to its uranium resources. The comments sparked a demand from the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, in question time for the Liberals to nominate â€œwhere the plants are going to beâ€?. On Wednesday Dutton confirmed that he appointed Ted Oâ€™Brien as shadow energy minister in part because a committee inquiry he chaired in 2019 recommended the partial lifting of the moratorium on nuclear energy to allow for â€œnew and emerging nuclear technologiesâ€?. The Coalition is still reviewing its energy policy to develop an emissions reduction target before the next election and study nuclear energy to develop a â€œproper base of informationâ€?, according to comments Dutton made in the party room in August.

Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dutton suggested nuclear energy could also help Australia â€œpower up irrigation and open up thousands of square kilometres of export opportunitiesâ€? before concluding the government should â€œat least allowâ€? the community to have a debate about it. In August the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, ruled out consideration of nuclear power because he said â€œit is by far the most expensive form of energyâ€?. â€œI mean, this is economic illiteracy from an opposition searching for relevance,â€? he told ABC News Breakfast. â€œ[Nuclear] is slow to deploy.

The decision by the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, which had been repeatedly delayed, was finally announced on Wednesday and went against the advice of the independent Planning Inspectorate. French energy company EDF wants to build the 3.2 GW, two-reactor plant next to its existing site at Sizewell B, which began operating in 1995. However, the proposals have faced fierce opposition from local campaigners, who have argued against the project because of the environmental impact and the cost to energy billpayers. Campaigners now have six weeks to decide whether to appeal against the decision. Planning permission was seen as a key hurdle for the project which remains subject to a further final investment decision, expected next year. It is hoped the plant can generate enough power for six million homes. The approval process for Sizewell C has so far included four rounds of public consultation which began in 2012 and has involved more than 10,000 East Suffolk residents. The Planning Inspectorate rejected the scheme because of concerns over the plantâ€™s impact on protected species and habitats, and the long-term water supply at the site. EDF worked with Chinese state-backed nuclear specialist CGN on the first phase of the project. However, it is understood the UK government is keen to ease CGN out amid concerns over Chinese involvement with sensitive assets. Bankers at Barclays have been hired to secure new financial backing for the project alongside EDF and the UK government. Boris Johnsonâ€™s government put Â£100m of funding behind the project in January to support its development. Carly Vince, the projectâ€™s chief planning officer, said: â€œSizewell C will be good for the region, creating thousands of opportunities for local people and businesses. It will boost local biodiversity and leave a legacy Suffolk can be proud of.â€? Julia Pyke, the director of financing for Sizewell C, said: â€œEnergy costs will be lower with nuclear in the mix, so todayâ€™s decision is good news for billpayers. The tried and tested funding arrangement we are proposing means that, by paying a small amount during construction, consumers will benefit in the long-term. â€œSizewell C will give a big boost to jobs and skills in nuclear supply chain companies across the country. It will strengthen the UKâ€™s energy security and play a key role in our fight against climate change.â€? Alison Downes, of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said: â€œThe wrong decision has been made but itâ€™s not the end of our campaign to Stop Sizewell C. Not only will we be looking closely at appealing this decision, weâ€™ll continue to challenge every aspect of Sizewell C, because â€“ whether it is the impact on consumers, the massive costs and delays, the outstanding technical questions or the environmental impacts â€“ it remains a very bad risk.â€? Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: â€œThe construction of the proposed development will be damaging and it has been granted with insufficient consideration for the effects on nature as described by the governmentâ€™s own experts. This is a ludicrous decision for an interim government to make.â€? Greenpeace UKâ€™s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, called the project a â€œred herring energy solutionâ€? as the UK attempts to move towards a low-carbon energy system. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the decision â€œsignificantly strengthens the pipeline of new nuclear capacity in Britainâ€?. Hinkley Point C in Somerset, also backed by EDF, has been beset by delays and cost over-runs. The French government said on Tuesday it was prepared to pay â‚¬10bn (Â£8.5bn) to fully nationalise EDF amid concerns over its finances. Ministers in France want to keep a handle on soaring energy bills. Johnson has set a target of making investment decisions on eight new nuclear projects by the end of the decade.","charCount":"4001","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/alex-lawson\">Alex Lawson</a> Energy correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/13/australia-will-have-unequivocal-control-over-nuclear-powered-submarines-insists-chief-advisor","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-13T09:38:50Z","webTitle":"Australia will have â€˜unequivocalâ€™ control over nuclear-powered submarines, insists chief adviser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/13/australia-will-have-unequivocal-control-over-nuclear-powered-submarines-insists-chief-advisor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/13/australia-will-have-unequivocal-control-over-nuclear-powered-submarines-insists-chief-advisor","fields":{"headline":"Australia will have â€˜unequivocalâ€™ control over nuclear-powered submarines, insists chief adviser","standfirst":"<p>â€˜When we take command of our first boat, we will have sovereign capabilityâ€™, says Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/feb/14/australia-politics-live-vanuatu-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-reconstruction-fund-reserve-bank-interest-rates-philip-lowe-cost-of-living-people-smugglers-protection-visas\">Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates</a></li><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_sfl\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul>","trailText":"â€˜When we take command of our first boat, we will have sovereign capabilityâ€™, says Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead","byline":"Daniel Hurst Foreign affairs and defence correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29d7a920bcf3c2c1dbe8f541bb31f5a908dd8790\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29d7a920bcf3c2c1dbe8f541bb31f5a908dd8790/0_0_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surfaced submarine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">USS Indiana, a nuclear-powered US Navy Virginia-class submarine.

The comments follow renewed debate in recent weeks over whether the flagship project of the Aukus pact â€“ which relies on support from the US and the UK â€“ will lead to an erosion of Australian sovereignty. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has been calling on the government to answer whether the submarines could be â€œoperated, sustained and maintained by Australia without the support or supervision of the US navyâ€?, and whether that effectively meant â€œsovereignty would be shared with the USâ€?. But the head of the taskforce advising the Australian government on the acquisition of at least eight submarines, Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, used an interview with ABC TV on Monday evening to assert Australian control. â€œWhen we take command of our first boat, we will have sovereign capability,â€? he told the 7.30 program. â€œWe will be commanding and controlling, under the Australian government direction, that nuclear-powered submarine.â€?

As the country braces for a winter of uncertainty amid fears that Russian gas could be cut off completely and electricity may be in short supply, the three-way coalition of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the pro-business FDP are looking for ways to ease the situation. Central to the debate is also how Germany hopes to maintain its climate goals, particularly after a recent decision â€“ backed by the Green economics minister â€“ to reignite highly polluting coal-fired power plants for a limited time. The proposal gaining ever more traction and making its mark in newspaper editorials and late-night television debates is for the countryâ€™s remaining three nuclear power plants, which are due to close at the end of the year, to be kept running, a move staunchly opposed by the Green party since it came into existence in the 1980s. Meanwhile, the FDP has not publicly signalled that it is ready to give up its enduring opposition to a speed limit on the autobahns, but the opposition Christian Democrats, under pressure from their close allies, have hinted they may be prepared to consider backing a temporary limit.

ADAC, which represents about 21 million German drivers, has said about 50% of its members are in favour of the introduction of a limit and 45% are against.","charCount":"4867","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/kateconnolly\">Kate Connolly</a> in Berlin"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/20/uk-nuclear-power-stations-decommissioning-cost","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-20T05:00:41Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear power stationsâ€™ decommissioning cost soars to Â£23.5bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/uk-nuclear-power-stations-decommissioning-cost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/20/uk-nuclear-power-stations-decommissioning-cost","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear power stationsâ€™ decommissioning cost soars to Â£23.5bn","standfirst":"<p>Failures in governmentâ€™s investment strategy mean taxpayer has contributed Â£10.7bn in just two years</p>","trailText":"Failures in governmentâ€™s investment strategy mean taxpayer has contributed Â£10.7bn in just two years","byline":"Sandra Laville Environment correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"776c954eae19afc446ea553ba367b891445010ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/776c954eae19afc446ea553ba367b891445010ae/370_0_7516_4513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dungeness B nuclear power station in Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dungeness B nuclear power station in Kent, one of the sites being decommissioned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Santa Cruz/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The cost of decommissioning the UKâ€™s seven ageing nuclear power stations has nearly doubled to Â£23.5bn and is likely to rise further, the public accounts committee has said.</p> <p>The soaring costs of safely decommissioning the advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs), including Dungeness B, Hunterston B and Hinkley B, are being loaded on to the taxpayer, <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmpubacc/118/report.html\">their report said</a>.</p> <p>Failures in the governmentâ€™s investment strategy for the fund, which was set up to pay for the decommissioning, have led to the taxpayer topping it up by an additional Â£10.7bn in just two years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/17/its-a-bribe-the-coastal-areas-that-could-become-the-uks-nuclear-dump\">â€˜Itâ€™s a bribeâ€™: the coastal areas that could become the UKâ€™s nuclear dump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The nuclear power stations are owned by EDF Energy and provide much of the UKâ€™s nuclear power-generated electricity, which makes up 16% of the energy mix.

Failures in the governmentâ€™s investment strategy for the fund, which was set up to pay for the decommissioning, have led to the taxpayer topping it up by an additional Â£10.7bn in just two years. The nuclear power stations are owned by EDF Energy and provide much of the UKâ€™s nuclear power-generated electricity, which makes up 16% of the energy mix. But the stations are nearing the end of their lives and are scheduled to stop generating electricity during this decade.

The public accounts committee also said it had concerns over whether the NDA had the capacity to take on the seven AGR stations in addition to its other responsibilities, which includes decommissioning the older Magnox reactors. It will cost the UK taxpayer Â£132bn to decommission all the UKâ€™s civil nuclear sites and the work will not be completed for another 120 years, according to latest estimates. Boris Johnson has pledged to build eight nuclear power stations in eight years. But the UK has no facility for permanently and safely storing the waste from past, present or future nuclear power stations. Most is currently stored at Sellafield, one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the world. Nuclear Waste Services, an arm of the government, is seeking a site to build a geological deposit facility deep underground for all the UKâ€™s nuclear waste. MPs on the public accounts committee said in their report on Friday the government must learn lessons from the rising costs of decommissioning the seven AGR reactors and be clear how the decommissioning of proposed new nuclear stations would be funded. The seven stations were sold by the government to EDF in 2009, with the later agreement that the French company would remove the fuel from the stations when they closed, and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority would take on the decommissioning of the sites. But the cost of decommissioning the seven AGR reactors that began to close last year, plus Sizewell B, has more than doubled from Â£12.6bn in 2004-05 to Â£23.5bn in 2020-21, the public accounts committee report said. â€œThere remain significant uncertainties that will need to be managed to prevent further increases in costs and ease pressures on the fund,â€? the report said. â€œThe cost of defuelling will depend on the stations not closing significantly earlier than planned and how quickly they can be defuelled once electricity generation ceases.â€? There was significant risk that the cost of decommissioning the seven AGRs would rise further, the report said. The public accounts committee, in a previous report, said the cost of decommissioning the older Magnox reactors â€“ which were the first generation of UK nuclear stations â€“ had increased by billions of pounds because of uncertainty over the condition of the sites and how to tackle the decommissioning. The PAC report said the closure of seven nuclear stations by 2028 would have a significant impact on energy production, but EDF has said there can be no extensions to the life of the reactors while the UK waits for new generating capacity to come online. â€¢ This article was amended on 20 May 2022 to refer correctly to Hunterston B power station, not â€œHunstanton Bâ€?.","charCount":"4439","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/sandralaville\">Sandra Laville</a> Environment correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainian-military-says-russian-attacks-repelled-in-kharkiv-and-kherson","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-19T18:06:22Z","webTitle":"Russian strike at Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant but reactors not damaged â€“ as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainian-military-says-russian-attacks-repelled-in-kharkiv-and-kherson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainian-military-says-russian-attacks-repelled-in-kharkiv-and-kherson","fields":{"headline":"Russian strike at Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant but reactors not damaged â€“ as it happened","standfirst":"<p>Reactors not damaged after Russian strikes at nuclear power plant in southern Mykolaiv region.

control of Luhansk region after Ukraine captures village</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ukraine</strong> has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of <strong>Lysychansk</strong>, in a small but symbolic victory that means <strong>Russia</strong> no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of <strong>Vladimir Putinâ€™s</strong> key war aims.</p> \n  <p>Luhanskâ€™s governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukraineâ€™s armed forces were in â€œcomplete controlâ€? of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bilohorivka,+Luhansk+Oblast,+93310/@48.927134,38.1171685,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x41200c585773dbe1:0x8961fec000b5c05c!8m2!3d48.926456!4d38.2459006\">Bilohorivka</a>. â€œItâ€™s a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,â€? he said, adding: â€œStep by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders.â€?</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://web.telegram.org/k/#@operativnoZSU\">Video footage shared on Telegram</a> showed Ukrainian soldiers patrolling on foot down a ruined street. Russian forces have occupied all of Luhansk province for the past two-and-a-half months. After a long and grinding battle Ukraineâ€™s general staff decided to retreat in July from the cities of Sievierdonetsk and Lysychansk.</p> \n  <p>Over the past 12 days Ukrainian regiments in the north-east have mounted a stunning counteroffensive, liberating more than 300 settlements across the Kharkiv region, and forcing Russian units to flee in disarray. The reclaimed area is half the size of Wales, and goes right up to the Russian border.</p> \n  <p>There were unconfirmed reports on Monday of Ukrainian troops advancing into Lysychansk. There now seems little prospect that the Kremlin will be able to take control of the whole of the Donbas, which includes Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. In March, Putin said this was the goal of his â€œspecial military operationâ€? in Ukraine, after his failed attempt to seize the capital Kyiv.</p> \n  <p>Over the weekend Russian troops shelled the city of Kupiansk from new, hastily constructed defensive positions just east of the Oskil River. Hundreds of people were evacuated. Ukraine said it took control of all of the city on Friday, crossing in amphibious vehicles over a pontoon bridge to the riverâ€™s left bank.</p> \n  <p>Ukrainian officials say 200 Russian soldiers died in a strike on Sunday when a missile hit a former bus shelter where they were based, in the frontline city of Svatove.</p> \n  <p>According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia has failed to send reinforcements. It is now under pressure and vulnerable to a further counter-offensive, the thinktank said.</p> \n  <p>Governor Haidai said the leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâ€™s Republic were beginning to panic. There have been numerous reports of snatch squads detaining men on the street and drafting them into the army.

Here is a summary of todayâ€™s events: Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly civilians at the mass burial site in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said on Monday. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraineâ€™s Kharkiv province as a â€œlieâ€?. Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region â€“ one of Vladimir Putinâ€™s key war aims. Ukraineâ€™s first lady Olena Zelenska said it was a â€œgreat honourâ€? to be present at the Queenâ€™s state funeral, â€œon behalf of all Ukrainiansâ€?. Denis Pushilin, head of the Russia-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine, has called on his fellow separatist leader of Luhansk province to combine efforts aimed at preparing a referendum on joining Russia. Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine may cause long-term grain prices to rise by 7% and expanded production elsewhere would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, a study finds. Russiaâ€™s foreign ministry has summoned the Canadian ambassador and issued a protest over attacks on the Russian embassy in Ottawa, it said. The Kremlin has said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said during a visit to China. Germanyâ€™s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfitâ€™s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations. German chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. The German central bank said it was increasingly likely that Europeâ€™s largest economy would shrink for a â€œprolongedâ€? period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. Germanyâ€™s defence minister Christine Lambrecht said her country will provide Ukraine with four additional self-propelled howitzers and ammunition. Thirteen people were killed in artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the cityâ€™s Russian-backed mayor said. Russian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraineâ€™s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraineâ€™s state nuclear company Energoatom said. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraineâ€™s Kharkiv province as a â€œlieâ€?. Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of Ukraine menâ€™s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putinâ€™s invading forces, the Guardian has revealed. The US president, Joe Biden, has warned Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a â€œconsequentialâ€? response from the US. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to around 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the UKâ€™s ministry of defence said. Russia was one of a small group of countries excluded from the Queenâ€™s state funeral in London today that included Belarus, Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russiaâ€™s president Vladimir Putin is â€œincreasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units,â€? in its latest update on the Russian campaign. On Sunday, Ukrainian civilians were fleeing heavy fighting as Russiaâ€™s armed forces tried to hold off a further dramatic advance by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. Ukrainian military said on Sunday its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east, Reuters reports. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region, while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let-up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russiaâ€™s invasion. The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the â€œdeath of our boys for illusory goalsâ€?. The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, has criticised Russia after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russiaâ€™s war crimes in Ukraine. Denis Pushilin, head of the Russia-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine, has called on his fellow separatist leader of Luhansk province to combine efforts aimed at preparing a referendum on joining Russia. Reuters reports that in a video posted on social media, he told Luhansk Peopleâ€™s Republic leader Leonid Pasechnik in a phone call that â€œour actions should be synchronisedâ€?. Germanyâ€™s defence minister Christine Lambrecht said her country will provide Ukraine with four additional self-propelled howitzers and ammunition. Lambrecht said the 10 howitzers already supplied by Germany and eight from the Netherlands â€œhave proven themselves in battle.â€? She said: Ukraine is full of praise of the system and has expressed a desire for more howitzers. In order to further support Ukraine in its brave fight against the brutal Russian attack, Germany will grant this request.â€? Lambrecht said the Panzerhaubitze 2000 model howitzers recently underwent refurbishment. Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of Vladimir Putinâ€™s key war aims. Luhanskâ€™s governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukraineâ€™s armed forces were in â€œcomplete controlâ€? of Bilohorivka. â€œItâ€™s a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,â€? he said, adding: â€œStep by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders.â€? Video footage shared on Telegram showed Ukrainian soldiers patrolling on foot down a ruined street. Russian forces have occupied all of Luhansk province for the past two-and-a-half months. After a long and grinding battle Ukraineâ€™s general staff decided to retreat in July from the cities of Sievierdonetsk and Lysychansk. Over the past 12 days Ukrainian regiments in the north-east have mounted a stunning counteroffensive, liberating more than 300 settlements across the Kharkiv region, and forcing Russian units to flee in disarray. The reclaimed area is half the size of Wales, and goes right up to the Russian border. There were unconfirmed reports on Monday of Ukrainian troops advancing into Lysychansk. There now seems little prospect that the Kremlin will be able to take control of the whole of the Donbas, which includes Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. In March, Putin said this was the goal of his â€œspecial military operationâ€? in Ukraine, after his failed attempt to seize the capital Kyiv. Over the weekend Russian troops shelled the city of Kupiansk from new, hastily constructed defensive positions just east of the Oskil River. Hundreds of people were evacuated. Ukraine said it took control of all of the city on Friday, crossing in amphibious vehicles over a pontoon bridge to the riverâ€™s left bank. Ukrainian officials say 200 Russian soldiers died in a strike on Sunday when a missile hit a former bus shelter where they were based, in the frontline city of Svatove. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia has failed to send reinforcements. It is now under pressure and vulnerable to a further counter-offensive, the thinktank said. Governor Haidai said the leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâ€™s Republic were beginning to panic. There have been numerous reports of snatch squads detaining men on the street and drafting them into the army. Mobile communications and the internet have been jammed, to prevent people learning about Moscowâ€™s military setbacks, he claimed. On Monday, Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin of reckless behaviour after a shell landed 300 metres from a nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region. The missile damaged buildings and blew out windows. Three power lines were temporarily knocked out at the Pivdennoukrainsk facility. You can read the full report here. More on the mass grave in Izium. Reuters reports that Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly civilians at the mass burial site in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said on Monday. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said around 450 bodies are believed to have been buried at the site in a forest on the outskirts of Izium, which was recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces during a counter-offensive in the Kharkiv region. A hearing in Moscow to decide on the future of the Jewish Agencyâ€™s activities in Russia has been postponed for four weeks after lawyers for the charity, which facilitates immigration of Jewish people to Israel, asked for time to submit amendments to the agencyâ€™s scope of operations. Russiaâ€™s justice ministry first recommended in June that the Jewish Agency - a quasi-governmental body - be shut down for violating Russian privacy laws. A hearing in August was delayed by the Basmanny city court to 19 September, and delayed again today for another four weeks. Israel has been caught in a delicate balancing act since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February: the country relies on Moscow to facilitate its military operations next-door in Syria, but has also faced pressure from its western allies to impose sanctions and forceful diplomatic action. Israelâ€™s caretaker prime minister, Yair Lapid, has warned that closing the Jewish Agencyâ€™s offices would be a severe blow to bilateral relations. About 24,000 Russians have arrived in Israel since the start of the war, and another 35,000 are waiting for paperwork to be processed, according to the Jewish Agency. Around 165,000 people with Jewish heritage were estimated to live in Russia at the beginning of 2022. Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine may cause long-term grain prices to rise by 7% and how expanded production elsewhere would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions. Russia and Ukraine together export about 28% of the worldâ€™s wheat supply. Researchers in the United States and Uruguay modelled the likely impact of the conflict on wheat and maize prices over the coming 12 months, looking at a variety of scenarios for the study published in Nature Food. One model found that if Russian grain exports were halved and Ukrainian exports significantly reduced during that time, maize would be 4.6% more expensive and wheat 7.2% more expensive - even assuming that other exporters could step in and plug the gap. The researchers said the price increase would persist as long as exports remained restricted, Agence France-Press reports. To close the supply shortfall, the study found that other major producers would need to expand their grain-growing areas significantly. Were all grain exports from Ukraine to cease, Australia would need to expand its wheat area by 1%, China by 1.5%, the European Union by 1.9% and India by 1.2%, according to the model. This land-use change would lead to just over a billion tonnes of additional carbon dioxide equivalent added to the atmosphere, the study said. Lead author Jerome Dumortier, a researcher at the Oâ€™Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs in Indianapolis in the US, said: The cropland expansion resulting from the war in Ukraine is occurring at the expense of more carbon emissions,â€? said United Nations chief Antonio Guterres warned in July that Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine had combined with the lingering trade impacts of Covid-19 to create an â€œunprecedented global hunger crisisâ€?. Figures from the UNâ€™s Food and Agriculture Organization show food prices are currently more than 10% higher than they were a year ago. Although Moscow and Kyiv reached an agreement in July to resume some grain exports, there are fears that the conflict could lead to years of elevated food prices. Dumortier said that it was not currently clear whether other grain producers were able to meet global demand, meaning prices could rise even further than predicted in the models. â€œThere are drought conditions in South America, Europe, and China, and export restrictions from various countries,â€? he told AFP. â€œGiven those hindrances to full adjustment, commodity prices may be higher than what is estimated in the paper.â€? Ukraineâ€™s first lady said it was a â€œgreat honourâ€? to be present at the Queenâ€™s state funeral, â€œon behalf of all Ukrainiansâ€?. Olena Zelenska, president Volodymyr Zelenskiyâ€™s wife, was among hundreds of heads of state and dignitaries from around the world gathered in Westminster Abbey for the service on Monday. She represented her nation at the ceremony on behalf of her husband, as he continues to organise the fightback against Russian invaders, PA News reports. Zelenska said the Queenâ€™s attention to Ukraine â€œwas an important signal of supportâ€?. She wrote on Twitter: She wished us better times and shared our desire for freedom. We will always remember it with deep gratitude.â€? On Sunday, Zelenska visited Westminster Hall for the Queenâ€™s lying in state to pay her respects to the Queen. She was pictured bowing her head as she stood alongside Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal and Ukraineâ€™s ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko. Earlier she met the Princess of Wales at Buckingham Palace. Zelenska travelled to the UK after her husband last week signed a book of condolence for the Queen. The UKâ€™s ambassador in Kyiv, Melinda Simmons, said she was â€œdeeply honouredâ€? by the presidentâ€™s gesture. She added: Grateful to the president for taking the time to do this given all else that is happening in (Ukraine) at this time.â€? Ukrainian troops have been taking part in a major counter-offensive against Russiaâ€™s forces. Zelenskiy appeared to be a fan of the Queen, having been given a biography of the Queen by Boris Johnson during the then-prime ministerâ€™s visit to Kyiv in June. Russiaâ€™s foreign ministry has summoned the Canadian ambassador and issued a protest over attacks on the Russian embassy in Ottawa, it said on Monday. Reuters reports that the ministry said an unknown person threw a Molotov cocktail on to the grounds of the Russian embassy in Ottawa. The ministry also said â€œaggressiveâ€? demonstrators had blocked an entrance to the consular section of the embassy. Here is a summary of events so far: The Kremlin has said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said on Monday during a visit to China. Germanyâ€™s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfitâ€™s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week. German chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said on Monday, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. The German central bank said on Monday it was increasingly likely that Europeâ€™s largest economy would shrink for a â€œprolongedâ€? period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. Thirteen people were killed in artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the cityâ€™s Russian-backed mayor said. Russian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraineâ€™s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraineâ€™s state nuclear company Energoatom said. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraineâ€™s Kharkiv province as a â€œlieâ€?. Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of Ukraine menâ€™s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putinâ€™s invading forces, the Guardian has revealed. The US president, Joe Biden, has warned Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a â€œconsequentialâ€? response from the US. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to about 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the British military said on Monday. Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine has added to the small group of countries excluded from the Queenâ€™s funeral in London today including Belarus, Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russiaâ€™s president Vladimir Putin is â€œincreasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units,â€? in its latest update on the Russian campaign. The Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in the south, where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east. On Sunday, Ukrainian civilians were fleeing heavy fighting as Russiaâ€™s armed forces tried to hold off a further dramatic advance by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east, Reuters reports. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region over the past day while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let-up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. In an intelligence update, Britainâ€™s defence ministry said Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, including a power grid and a dam, had intensified. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russiaâ€™s invasion. The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the past 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the â€œdeath of our boys for illusory goalsâ€?. The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, levelled heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russiaâ€™s war crimes in Ukraine. A selection of recent pictures from the agencies My colleagues Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw report on the Ukrainian recapture of Shevchenkove, Kharkiv region, with liberated Ukrainians telling of life under occupation. Until last week, a portrait of Vladimir Putin hung on the wall of the mayorâ€™s office in the town of Shevchenkove, Kharkiv region. There was a Russian flag. Around a cabinet table, a pro-Kremlin â€œleaderâ€?, Andrey Strezhko, held meetings with colleagues. There was a lot to discuss. One topic: a referendum on joining Russia. Another: a new autumn curriculum for Shevchenkoveâ€™s two schools, minus anything Ukrainian. Strezhkoâ€™s ambitious plans were never realised. On 8 September, Ukraineâ€™s armed forces launched a surprise counteroffensive. They swiftly recaptured a swathe of territory in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, including Shevchenkove. Most residents greeted the soldiers with hugs and kisses. Strezhko disappeared. He is believed to have fled across the Russian border, along with other collaborators. Shevchenkoveâ€™s acting military administrator, Andrii Konashavych, pointed to the chair where the pseudo-mayor had sat in the council building. On the wall was a portrait of Taras Shevchenko, Ukraineâ€™s national poet who gives his name to the town. What happened to the Putin photo? â€œWe tore it up,â€? Konashavych said. Why was there no picture of President Zelenskiy? â€œPresidents come and go. Shevchenko is eternal,â€? he replied. Read the full report here. The Kremlin said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said on Monday during a visit to China. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the national security council chaired by Russian president Vladimir Putin, described the â€œstrengthening of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation with Beijing as an unconditional priority of Russiaâ€™s foreign policy.â€? During a meeting with Guo Shengkun, a top official of Chinaâ€™s Communist party, Patrushev said: In the current conditions, our countries must show even greater readiness for mutual support and development of cooperation.â€? After the talks in the Chinese city of Nanping, Patrushevâ€™s office said in a statement that the parties agreed to: â€¦expand information exchanges on countering extremism and foreign attempts to undermine the constitutional order of both countries in order to derail independent policies of Russia and China serving their national interests.â€? The Chinese and Russian officials also emphasized a need to expand cooperation on cybersecurity and bolster contacts between their law enforcement agencies on fighting terrorism. The statement didnâ€™t offer any further details of prospective cooperation. Putin met with Chinese president Xi Jinping last week in Uzbekistan, their first encounter since the Russian leader invaded Ukraine in February. A Chinese government statement issued after the meeting said Xi promised â€œstrong supportâ€? for Russiaâ€™s â€œcore interests.â€? Germanyâ€™s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfitâ€™s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week. The German Left partyâ€™s future has hung in a precarious balance since it snuck into the national parliament last autumn under a special provision for parties that win three or more constituency seats. Should three of its 39 delegates resign from the party, Die Linke would lose its status as a parliamentary group and attached privileges over speaking times and committee memberships. Party insiders say such resignations are a matter of when, not if, after a week of vicious public in-fighting over a speech in which the former co-leader Sahra Wagenknecht accused the German government of â€œlaunching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplierâ€?. Read the full report here. The Associated Press has a preview of this weekâ€™s meeting of the UN general assembly: Facing a complex set of challenges that try humanity as never before, world leaders convene at the United Nations this week under the shadow of Europeâ€™s first major war since World War II â€” a conflict that has unleashed a global food crisis and divided major powers in a way not seen since the Cold War. The many facets of the Ukraine war are expected to dominate the annual meeting, which convenes as many countries and peoples confront growing inequality, an escalating climate crisis, the threat of multiple famines and an internet-fuelled tide of misinformation and hate speech â€” all atop a coronavirus pandemic that is halfway through its third year. For the first time since the United Nations was founded atop the ashes of World War II, European nations are witnessing war in their midst waged by nuclear-armed neighbouring Russia. Its invasion not only threatens Ukraineâ€˜s survival as an independent democratic nation but has leaders in many countries worrying about trying to preserve regional and international peace and prevent a wider war. The UN secretary-general, AntÃ³nio Guterres, said the strategic divides â€” with the west on one side and Russia and increasingly China on the other â€” are â€œparalysing the global response to the dramatic challenges we faceâ€?. He pointed not only to the devastation in Ukraine from nearly seven months of fighting but to the warâ€™s impact on the global economy. Escalating food and energy prices are hitting the worldâ€™s poorest people hardest, and nations are â€œbeing devoured by the acids of nationalism and self-interestâ€? instead of working together and resolving disputes peacefully, two principles that lie at the heart of the UN charter and underpin everything the United Nations tries to do. German chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said on Monday, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. Scholz, whose two-day trip will also take him to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, will become the latest Western leader to meet with the crown prince. Bin Salman has been regarded as a pariah in the West due to his suspected role in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. But he is being courted again as Europe and its allies urgently seek fresh sources of fossil fuels after Russia cut gas supplies amid soaring tensions over its invasion of Ukraine. Agence France-Press reports: Scholz, accompanied by a business delegation, will visit Saudi Arabia on Saturday, where he will meet with the crown prince and - if his health permits it - King Salman, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said. He did not go into detail about the reasons for Scholzâ€™s Gulf visit but said he would be â€œvery surprisedâ€? if the topic of energy was not discussed. The spokesman also offered assurances that â€œthe murder of Mr Khashoggi will certainly figure in discussionsâ€?. It is the latest sign of bin Salmanâ€™s international rehabilitation - in July, French President Emmanuel Macron held talks with him in Paris, and US President Joe Biden visited the kingdom. On Sunday, Scholz will head to the UAE and meet with President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and in the afternoon will hold talks with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani. German economy minister Robert Habeck already visited Qatar and the UAE in March in an effort to find alternatives to Russian gas, which Germany has traditionally depended on heavily. Russiaâ€™s decision to cut off supplies has triggered an energy crisis in Europe, with consumers and businesses facing soaring bills as winter approaches. Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine have sentenced an employee of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) - the worldâ€™s largest regional security organisation - to 13 years in jail on treason charges, Russian news agencies reported Monday. â€œA panel of judges found Dmitry Pavlovich Shabanov guilty â€¦ and sentenced him to 13 years in prison,â€? the RIA Novosti news agency reported, quoting the supreme court of the self-proclaimed Lugansk Peopleâ€™s Republic (LNR). Shabanov, who was detained in April, is accused of passing confidential information to foreign intelligence services, Agence France-Presse reports. According to separatist authorities, Shabanov was recruited in 2016 by a former officer of Ukraineâ€™s SBU security service and an agent in Ukraine of the US Central Intelligence Agency. Between August 2021 and April 2022, he collected â€œinformation on the movements of military equipment as well as units of the Lugansk Peopleâ€™s Armyâ€? and â€œsent them to the CIA agentâ€?, the separatists said. The OSCE has â€œunequivocallyâ€? condemned the charges against Shabanov and Mikhail Petrov, another OSCE staffer detailed in April, describing the allegations as â€œtotally unacceptable so-called â€˜legal proceedingsâ€™â€?. The OSCE mission, which has been deployed in the conflict zone since 2014, left the separatist regions of Donetsk and Lugansk in the wake of Russiaâ€™s offensive in Ukraine earlier this year. Here is what we know so far regarding the more than 440 graves that have been uncovered in a forest near Izium in eastern Ukraine. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), some of the bodies recovered had their hands tied. Others showed signs of having suffered violence. Last week, Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced the discovery of a mass grave in Izium after it was recaptured from the Russians. At one burial site, more than 440 graves dating between March and September 2022 were discovered. Investigators have exhumed the bodies of at least 17 Ukrainian soldiers from one site. A cross over the grave bore the inscription: â€œUkrainian army, 17 people. Izium morgue.â€? The authorities say there are more than 440 tombs because the last number entered on the crosses is 445. Some of the crosses are made from varnished wood and also carry names and dates. Investigators say about 100 bodies have been exhumed. Ukrainian officials suspect that some of the dead were tortured by Russian forces during their occupation of the north-east Kharkiv region. At least two of the bodies recovered were found with their hands tied, AFP journalists said. One of the two â€œhad their hands tied, their jaw broken and two stab wounds in the backâ€?, a member of the Kharkiv prosecutorâ€™s office told AFP on condition of anonymity. The remains have been identified as that of a pro-Ukrainian volunteer fighter, the official added. Civilians who died during fighting in March for control of the city have also been exhumed. Around 10 teams â€“ each of around four people, including representatives of the prosecutorâ€™s office â€“ have been at work investigating following the discovery of the graves. Emergency service workers in white overalls were handling the exhumations. Kharkiv prosecutor Yevgen Sokolov, who is leading the investigation, said he did not have an exact number for those thought to have suffered violent deaths. Of the bodies so far exhumed, he said â€œmost have wounds from shelling and explosionsâ€?. Others had suffered â€œinjuries from sharp objects and showed signs of violent deathâ€?, he said. Sokolov said one combatant had had â€œhis hands tied behind his backâ€? and another was found with â€œrope around the neck and broken limbsâ€?. He also said a body was exhumed â€œwith multiple stab woundsâ€?. â€œAt this point, we donâ€™t have bodies with bullets in their skulls but there is still a lot of work to be done,â€? he said. If the weather remained mild, he estimated it would take another week to finish exhuming the bodies. Europeâ€™s imports of thermal coal in 2022 could be the highest in at least four years and may rise further next year, analysts said on Monday, highlighting the extent of the energy crisis following sanctions on Russia, Reuters reports. European imports of thermal coal this year could rise to about 100m tonnes, the most since 2017, according to Noble Resources International Pte Ltd, while commodities pricing agency Argus expects shipments to reach a four-year high. â€œEurope is going back in time,â€? Rodrigo Echeverri, head of research at Noble, told a conference. European governments have outlined new measures on how they will cope with potential energy shortages this winter, with Russian gas flows still running at severely reduced rates amid the Ukraine war. Reuters reports that Spain has drawn up plans that could force energy-intensive industries to shut at peak demand times. France said it was preparing to send gas to Germany from October, while Berlin said Europeâ€™s powerhouse was still in talks on state aid for ailing utility Uniper. Russia, which had supplied about 40% of the European Unionâ€™s gas before its February invasion of Ukraine, has said it closed the Nord Stream 1 pipeline â€“ once one of Europeâ€™s major gas supply routes â€“ because western sanctions hindered operations. European gas prices have more than doubled from the start of the year amid a decline in Russian supplies. The sharp drop in Russian fuel exports has left governments scrambling to find energy resources, but also to warn that power cuts could happen, amid fears of recession. In France, exports of natural gas to Germany could start around 10 October, the head of Franceâ€™s CRE energy regulator said, following an announcement by president Emmanuel Macron that the two EU neighbours would help each other with electricity and gas flows amid the crisis. CRE chief Emmanuelle Wargon told FranceInfo radio: Gas was (until now) only flowing from Germany to France, so we did not have the technical tools to reverse the flows and we did not even have a method to regulate prices.â€? Wargon added that â€œexceptionalâ€? measures this winter could include localised electricity cuts if the winter is cold and EDFâ€™s plans to repair corrosion-hit nuclear reactors are delayed. â€œBut there will be no gas cuts for households. Never,â€? she said. Spanish industry minister Reyes Maroto said that obliging energy-intensive companies to close down during consumption peaks is an option on the table this winter if required. The companies would be compensated financially, she said adding there is no need to impose such closures now. And Finns were warned they should be prepared for power outages. National grid operator Fingrid said: As a result of great uncertainties, Finns should be prepared for power outages caused by a possible power shortage in the coming winter.â€? Finnish power retailer Karhu Voima Oy said it had filed for bankruptcy due to a sharp rise in electricity price rises. German finance minister Christian Lindner said on Monday that he was still looking at ways to ensure gas prices remained affordable for people while awaiting recommendations from a group of experts. When asked about a possible cap on gas prices Lindner said: We have developed this commission, but proposals within the federal government are also being considered further, so it has not been completely outsourced.â€? The German central bank said on Monday it was increasingly likely that Europeâ€™s largest economy would shrink for a â€œprolongedâ€? period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. In its monthly report, the Bundesbank said: The signs of a recession for the German economy are multiplying.â€? It also warned of a â€œbroad-based and prolonged decline in economic outputâ€?. The likely slump was above all down to â€œsupply-side constraintsâ€?, namely reduced deliveries of energy in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reports. Moscow has drastically reduced it supplies of gas to Europe and kept the Nord Stream pipeline shut since the end of August, heaping pressure on Germanyâ€™s economy. Germany had been highly reliant on Russian energy imports with 55% of its gas coming from Russia before the outbreak of the war. The economy would likely shrink â€œslightlyâ€? in the third quarter of the year, the Bundesbank said, before a â€œmarkedâ€? drop over the last three months of 2022 and the beginning of 2023. The Russian gas supply stop meant that the situation regarding gas markets was â€œvery tenseâ€?, it said. Germany could â€œavoid formal rationingâ€? of the fuel, but necessary reductions in consumption would lead companies to limit or pause production, the central bank predicted. Thirteen people were killed in artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the cityâ€™s Russian-backed mayor said. Reuters reports that in a statement posted on the Telegram messenger app, Donetskâ€™s separatist mayor Alexei Kulemzin said that 13 civilians including two children had been killed in the strike on Donetskâ€™s Kuybyshevsky district. He said that the number of wounded was being confirmed. Donetsk city has been controlled by the Russian-backed Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic since 2014. The Ukrainian army continues to hold positions on Donetskâ€™s outskirts, and the city has come under artillery fire repeatedly in recent months. The Guardian is unable to verify battlefield reports. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraineâ€™s Kharkiv province as a â€œlieâ€?. About 450 bodies, most of which Ukraine says are those of civilians, have been found in mass graves near Izium after Russian troops were this month forced out of the Kharkiv region, much of which they had controlled since the first weeks of their military campaign in Ukraine. Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said investigators at the site had found evidence of torture, including bodies with hands tied, and accused Russian troops of committing war crimes. Asked on Monday about Zelenskiyâ€™s statements, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters: â€œItâ€™s the same scenario as in Bucha. Itâ€™s a lie, and of course we will defend the truth in this story.â€? Russia previously rejected claims that its troops had committed war crimes in Bucha, outside Kyiv, after evidence of civilians being killed while the town was controlled by Russian troops came to light after Russiaâ€™s withdrawal at the end of March. (Via Reuters) Last week, Zelenskiy accused Russia of â€œleaving death everywhereâ€? after the discovery of the Izium site. Men in white overalls began digging out bodies last Friday as part of a mass exhumation at the site, reporters with the Reuters news agency said, and 20 white bodybags could be seen. Reuters reported that several bodies had rope tied around their necks and hands. Ukraineâ€™s atomic energy operator, Energoatom, has described the Russian missile strike on the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant â€“ see earlier post here â€“ as an act of â€œnuclear terrorismâ€?. (Via AP) Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of the Ukraine menâ€™s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putinâ€™s invading forces, the Guardian can reveal. The Football Union of Russia has written to the governing body accusing Oleksandr Petrakov of discriminating against Russians and failing to remain politically neutral. Denis Rogachev, the deputy secretary general of the FUR, cited comments carried in two newspapers â€“ Italyâ€™s Corriere dello Sport and Russiaâ€™s Sport Express â€“ as evidence of Petrakovâ€™s guilt. In a letter to Uefaâ€™s control, ethics and disciplinary body, Petrakov is accused of breaching codes of conduct by calling for Russians to be banned from international sport and talking about his hopes of joining the armed forces. Full story here. The US president, Joe Biden, used an interview with CBSâ€™s 60 Minutes programme on Sunday night to warn Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a â€œconsequentialâ€? response from the US. When asked what he would tell Putin if the Russian leader was mulling such a move, he said: â€œDonâ€™t. Donâ€™t. Donâ€™t.â€? Biden praised the Ukrainians for their gritty fight against the Russian invasion and said: â€œTheyâ€™re defeating Russiaâ€?. Asked how to define victory for Kyiv, he said: â€œWinning the war in Ukraine is to get Russia out of Ukraine completely.â€? But given the scale of human suffering and destruction inflicted in resisting the Russian onslaught, â€œitâ€™s awful hard to count that as winningâ€?, he added. Reuters has more information on the Russian strike on the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in the early hours of Monday: Russian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraineâ€™s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraineâ€™s state nuclear company Energoatom said. A blast took place 300 metres away from the reactors and damaged power plant buildings shortly after midnight, Energoatom said in a statement. The attack has also damaged a nearby hydroelectric power plant and transmission lines. Energoatom said: Currently, all three power units of the PNPP (Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant) are operating normally. Fortunately, there were no casualties among the station staff It published two photographs showing a crater it said was caused by the blast. In one of the pictures a man stood in the crater to give a sense of its size. Commenting on the strike on the Telegram messaging app, Ukraineâ€˜s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: The invaders wanted to shoot again, but they forgot what a nuclear power plant is. Russia endangers the whole world. We have to stop it before itâ€™s too late. There was no immediate Russian reaction to Ukraineâ€™s accusations. The Mykolaiv region has been under constant rocket attack by Russian forces in recent weeks. Another Ukrainian nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia - which is Europeâ€™s largest and lies about 250km (155 miles) east of the Mykolaiv site - was shut down earlier this month due to Russian shelling, prompting concerns about a possible nuclear disaster. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is held by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff. The shelling has damaged buildings and disrupted power lines. The UN nuclear watchdog said this weekend one of the four main power lines at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility had been repaired and was once again supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid. Russian troops have struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region, but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Reuters reports. According to Ukraineâ€™s state nuclear company, Energoatom, a blast early on Monday took place 300 metres from the reactors and damaged power plant buildings. The attack has also damaged a nearby hydroelectric power plant and transmission lines. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to about 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the British military said on Monday. There is a realistic possibility that the increase in losses was partially a result of the Russian air force accepting greater risk in a move to provide close air support to Russian ground forces under pressure from Ukrainian advances, the defence ministry said in its daily intelligence on Twitter. Russian pilotsâ€™ situational awareness is often poor, it said. â€œThere is a realistic possibility that some aircraft have strayed over enemy territory and into denser air defence zones as the frontlines have moved rapidly.â€? (Via Reuters) Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine has added to the small group of countries excluded from the Queenâ€™s funeral in London today, as AFP reports: Russiaâ€™s president, Vladimir Putin â€“ under a travel ban to the UK due to sanctions â€“ had already said he would not attend. But not inviting any Russian representative to the Queenâ€™s funeral was â€œparticularly blasphemous towards Elizabeth IIâ€™s memoryâ€? and â€œdeeply immoralâ€?, the foreign ministry spokeswoman in Moscow said on Thursday. Russia and Belarus have embassies in London and their presidents sent King Charles III messages of condolences. Other countries with no invitations are Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Good morning. This is Sam Jones taking over now from my colleague Virginia. Ukrainians flee shelling of Kupiansk as Russian forces try to slow advances On Sunday, Ukrainian civilians were fleeing heavy fighting as Russiaâ€™s armed forces tried to hold off a further dramatic advance by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. As Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw report, cars packed with families streamed out of the city of Kupiansk, which Ukraine recaptured just over a week ago as part of a stunning counter-offensive. Kupiansk, a strategic railway junction, sits on either side of the river. It is on the new frontline after Ukrainian forces on Friday crossed to the right bank. They are now poised to push further into Luhansk province, which the Kremlin and its local proxies have controlled entirely since June, and partly since 2014. Hereâ€™s the full story. Russian pop star speaks out against war in Ukraine The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the â€œdeath of our boys for illusory goalsâ€?. The remarks are the first time that the pop star, an icon in Russia, has publicly criticised the conflict. Addressing the Russian justice ministry, Pugacheva told her 3.4 million Instagram followers: â€œI am asking you to include me on the foreign agents list of my beloved country.â€? Read more here. Milley: â€œNot going too well for Russiaâ€? The top US general on Sunday said it was still unclear how Russia might react to the latest battlefield setbacks in Ukraine and called for vigilance among US troops as he visited a base in Poland aiding Ukraineâ€™s war effort, Reuters reported. â€œThe war is not going too well for Russia right now. So itâ€™s incumbent upon all of us to maintain high states of readiness, alert,â€? US Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Warsaw. Milley said he was not suggesting US troops in Europe were at any increased threat, but said they had to be ready. â€œIn the conduct of war, you just donâ€™t know with a high degree of certainty what will happen next.â€? Some recent images from Kharkiv, Ukraine. Russian attacks in east and south repelled, says Ukraine military Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east, Reuters reports. It said Ukrainian troops had advanced to the eastern bank of the Oskil River in Kharkiv region. â€œFrom yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,â€? it said on Telegram. Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the neighbouring Luhansk region, said this meant the â€œde-occupationâ€? of his region was â€œnot far awayâ€?. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russia president Vladimir Putin is â€œincreasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units,â€? in its latest update on the Russian campaign. â€œPutinâ€™s souring relationship with the military command and the Russian (MoD) may explain in part the Kremlinâ€™s increasing focus on recruiting ill-prepared volunteers into ad-hoc irregular units rather than attempting to draw them into reserve or replacement pools for regular Russian combat units,â€? the ISW said. Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Iâ€™m Virginia Harrison and Iâ€™ll be with you for the next hour or so. Itâ€™s just after 8am in Kyiv and these are the main developments: The Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in the south, where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east. It said Ukrainian troops had advanced to the eastern bank of the Oskil River in Kharkiv region. â€œFrom yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,â€? it said on Telegram. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region over the past day while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. â€œPerhaps it seems to some of you that after a series of victories we now have a lull of sorts,â€? he said in his nightly address on Sunday. â€œBut there will be no lull. There is preparation for the next series ... For Ukraine must be free. All of it.â€? In an intelligence update, Britainâ€™s defence ministry said Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, including a power grid and a dam, had intensified. â€œAs it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government,â€? it said on Sunday. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russiaâ€™s invasion. â€œTheyâ€™re not willing to scrap it,â€? one soldier said, recalling artillery with shrapnel damage and sometimes completely worn out from firing round after round against Russian troops. The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. According to a Ukrainian military official who spoke to the New York Times, remnants of the Shahed-136 attack drones have been discovered on the ground during the counteroffensive that Ukraine launched in the north-eastern regions of the country this month. The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the past 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent reported on Sunday that Ukraineâ€™s Air Force had successfully targeted 15 Russian strongholds and four sites, as well as seven control points. The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the â€œdeath of our boys for illusory goalsâ€?. The remarks are the first time that the pop star, an icon in Russia, has publicly criticised the conflict. Addressing the Russian justice ministry, Pugacheva told her 3.4 million Instagram followers: â€œI am asking you to include me on the foreign agents list of my beloved country.â€? The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, levelled heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week. Zourabichvili condemned â€œin the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russia in Iziumâ€?, adding that â€œthese war crimes must be answered by justiceâ€?, the Kyiv Independent reported. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russiaâ€™s war crimes in Ukraine. â€œObviously the UK and Canada have been two of the strongest countries in standing up in support of Ukraine and pushing back against Russiaâ€™s illegal actions,â€? Trudeau told reporters in London.","charCount":"50622","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/jane-clinton\">Jane Clinton</a> (now);  <a href=\"profile/samjones\">Sam Jones</a> and <a href=\"profile/virginia-harrison\">Virginia Harrison</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/25/japan-eyes-return-to-nuclear-power-more-than-a-decade-after-fukushima-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T04:32:55Z","webTitle":"Japan eyes return to nuclear power more than a decade after Fukushima disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/25/japan-eyes-return-to-nuclear-power-more-than-a-decade-after-fukushima-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/25/japan-eyes-return-to-nuclear-power-more-than-a-decade-after-fukushima-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Japan eyes return to nuclear power more than a decade after Fukushima disaster","standfirst":"<p>Move designed to secure energy supplies would mark a dramatic shift in Japanâ€™s policy stance held since 2011 reactor meltdown</p>","trailText":"Move would mark a dramatic shift in energy policy stance held since 2011 reactor meltdown, to wean Japan off nuclear power","byline":"Justin McCurry in Tokyo","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb69a56a3aff766c1d0ab47c972c200626d9971e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb69a56a3aff766c1d0ab47c972c200626d9971e/0_397_6615_3969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers construct water storage tanks at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2020. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers construct water storage tanks at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2020.

Itâ€™s a question of time before it resumes.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On Wednesday, Russia launched 70 missiles against infrastructure targets across Ukraine, leaving about 80 per cent of the country in the dark and without water. <br><br>All 15 of Ukraineâ€™s nuclear reactors were taken offline because electricity became unstable. <br><br>Speaking in the presidential office, which was also out of water supply, Zelenskyy said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>It was the kind of incident that hasnâ€™t happened for I donâ€™t know how many years, maybe 80, 90 years: a country on the European continent where there was totally no light.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The state superbly fought back. Energy workers, the state emergenciesâ€™ ministry, deminers, everyone worked to fix and restore power and provide at least a bit of water.</em></p> \n   <p><em>This is a war about strength, about resilience, it is about who stands stronger.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Zelenskyy also appealed to Ukraineâ€™s western partners to provide more air defence equipment to help protect critical infrastructure, as well as diesel supplies for emergency generators and additional gas to help offset power shortages. <br><br>The president said the attacks targeting civilian infrastructure showed Moscow had no intention of negotiating an end to the war. Kyiv has been pushing back at perceived pressure to show its openness to an eventual negotiated solution to the war. <br><br>Some western partners are concerned that any attempt by Ukraine to take back Crimea â€” annexed by Russia in 2014 and which it deems crucial for its security â€” could lead to a dangerous escalation by Moscow, possibly even the use of nuclear weapons. <br><br>As Ukrainian forces have made advances against Russian troops in the south and east, Ukraineâ€™s military aims have hardened: it is seeking the return of territory occupied since February and land occupied in the 2014 Russian assault. <br><br>Zelenskyy acknowledged that the fate of Crimea was rising on the international agenda. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>I understand that everyone is confused by the situation and what will happen to Crimea. If someone is ready to offer us a way regarding the de-occupation of Crimea by non-military means, I will only be in favour.<br><br>If the solution [does not involve] de-occupation and [Crimea] is part of the Russian Federation, no one should waste their time on this.

Russian forces shelled both areas and used incendiary devices to set Ukrainian positions ablaze with only limited success, the general staff said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russiaâ€™s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the â€œSouth Streamâ€? gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported.</strong> The pipeline was a project intended to transport Russian gas through the Black Sea to Bulgaria, although was later cancelled in favour of TurkStream.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Polish leaders say that an air defence system which Germany offered Poland would be best given to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> to help it protect itself against Russian strikes. </strong>Germany said earlier this week that it has offered Warsaw Eurofighter planes and Patriot defence systems to help defend Polandâ€™s airspace after two men were killed when an apparently stray Ukrainian defence projectile fell in Poland near the border with Ukraine, the Associated Press reported.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Hungary will provide â‚¬187m ($195m) in financial aid to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to â‚¬18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. </strong>Prime minister Viktor OrbÃ¡nâ€™s government has said it was willing to pay its share of support for Ukraine but would rather pay it bilaterally than through the EUâ€™s joint borrowing, Reuters reported.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations security council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure</strong> that have again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Russia unleashed a missile barrage across Ukraine on Wednesday, killing 10 people, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and cutting water and electricity supply in many places.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Neighbouring Moldova said it was suffering massive blackouts caused by the missile barrage</strong> and its EU-friendly president, Maia Sandu, accused Russia of leaving her country â€œin the darkâ€?.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>European Union governments failed to reach a deal on Wednesday on the level at which to cap prices for Russian sea-borne oil under the G7 scheme</strong> and will resume talks, EU diplomats said. Earlier on Thursday, EU representatives met in Brussels. The move is part of sanctions intended to slash Moscowâ€™s revenue from its oil exports so it has less money to finance the invasion of Ukraine.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The resignation of Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Unesco will end the deadlock in a key group he chaired that is charged with preserving cultural sites around the world, a diplomatic source told AFP.</strong> The World Heritage Committee, responsible for adding properties to Unescoâ€™s list of world heritage sites, had been unable to function for months after the international backlash against Russiaâ€™s invasion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraineâ€™s military said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/23/strike-on-ukrainian-hospital-maternity-ward-zaporizhzhia-kills-newborn-baby\">Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country</a> and also deployed attack drones.</strong> The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thatâ€™s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now.

More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official at the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) said. European Union governments remained split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscowâ€™s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with further talks expected on Friday. Six of the EUâ€™s 27 countries are said to be opposed the price cap level proposed by the G7, which will come into force on 5 December. Hungaryâ€™s Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that Hungaryâ€™s parliament will ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow confirmed Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraineâ€™s responsibility, and that if it does not â€œstopâ€?, it will end in the â€œcomplete destructionâ€? of the country. He said that similar to relations with Germany following the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded â€œwe will make it all upâ€?. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. Russia risked causing a â€œnuclear and radioactive catastropheâ€? by launching attacks in which all Ukraineâ€™s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraineâ€™s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. Ukraine expects the three nuclear power plants will be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscowâ€™s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. She said the EU would â€œhit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraineâ€?. More than two-thirds of the Ukrainian capital was still without power on Thursday morning and a number of residents had no running water, a day after Russian missile strikes caused Kyivâ€™s biggest outages in nine months of war. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014. Russiaâ€™s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the â€œSouth Streamâ€? gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported. Hungary will provide â‚¬187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to â‚¬18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations security council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that have again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Neighbouring Moldova said it was suffering massive blackouts caused by the missile barrage and its EU-friendly president, Maia Sandu, accused Russia of leaving her country â€œin the darkâ€?. Ukraineâ€™s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. Iâ€™m closing the blog now for the day but it will reopen again tomorrow morning. Thanks again for following. The Financial Times has an interview with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which he said Russiaâ€™s new strategy to destroy Ukraineâ€™s infrastructure and plunge it into darkness would not weaken the countryâ€™s resolve to liberate all occupied land, describing the conflict as a â€œwar of strength and resilienceâ€?. Pushing back against western fears of escalation, Ukraineâ€™s president insisted there would be no lasting resolution to the war unless Russia withdrew from all the territories it was occupying. Moscow has stepped up a bombing campaign against Ukraineâ€™s critical infrastructure since last month, hoping to force Kyiv to make concessions despite its advances on the battlefield. Zelenskyy said: We must return all landsâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰. because I believe that the battlefield is the way when there is no diplomacy. If you canâ€™t get your land back entirely, the war is simply frozen. Itâ€™s a question of time before it resumes. On Wednesday, Russia launched 70 missiles against infrastructure targets across Ukraine, leaving about 80 per cent of the country in the dark and without water. All 15 of Ukraineâ€™s nuclear reactors were taken offline because electricity became unstable. Speaking in the presidential office, which was also out of water supply, Zelenskyy said: It was the kind of incident that hasnâ€™t happened for I donâ€™t know how many years, maybe 80, 90 years: a country on the European continent where there was totally no light. The state superbly fought back. Energy workers, the state emergenciesâ€™ ministry, deminers, everyone worked to fix and restore power and provide at least a bit of water. This is a war about strength, about resilience, it is about who stands stronger. Zelenskyy also appealed to Ukraineâ€™s western partners to provide more air defence equipment to help protect critical infrastructure, as well as diesel supplies for emergency generators and additional gas to help offset power shortages. The president said the attacks targeting civilian infrastructure showed Moscow had no intention of negotiating an end to the war. Kyiv has been pushing back at perceived pressure to show its openness to an eventual negotiated solution to the war. Some western partners are concerned that any attempt by Ukraine to take back Crimea â€” annexed by Russia in 2014 and which it deems crucial for its security â€” could lead to a dangerous escalation by Moscow, possibly even the use of nuclear weapons. As Ukrainian forces have made advances against Russian troops in the south and east, Ukraineâ€™s military aims have hardened: it is seeking the return of territory occupied since February and land occupied in the 2014 Russian assault. Zelenskyy acknowledged that the fate of Crimea was rising on the international agenda. I understand that everyone is confused by the situation and what will happen to Crimea. If someone is ready to offer us a way regarding the de-occupation of Crimea by non-military means, I will only be in favour. If the solution [does not involve] de-occupation and [Crimea] is part of the Russian Federation, no one should waste their time on this. Itâ€™s a waste of time. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official at the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) has said. Reuters reports: The Hague-based organisation, created in the wake of the Balkan wars of the 1990s, opened an office in Kyiv in July to help Ukraine to document and track down missing people. The ICMPâ€™s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from their family members, or had died and had been buried in makeshift graves. The process of investigating the missing in Ukraine will last years even after fighting stops, Holliday told Reuters in an interview. The 15,000 figure is conservative when considering that in the port city of Mariupol alone authorities estimate as many as 25,000 people are either dead or missing. He said: The numbers are huge and the challenges that Ukraine faces are vast. Besides which theyâ€™re fighting an ongoing war as well against the Russian Federation. What is key now is setting in place all the correct measures to ensure that as many persons can be identified. The vast majority of missing persons, those deceased, are victims of war crimes, and the perpetrators need to be held responsible. By storing DNA samples on a database and seeking matches with relatives, the ICMP accounted for more than 27,000 out of 40,000 persons reported missing during the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. In Kyiv, the ICMP has started to collect DNA samples and is ramping up capacity for a multi-year process that will also help prosecutors build war crimes cases. The Guardianâ€™s video team have published footage of medics at a hospital in the Ukrainian capital carrying out a cardiac operation on a child despite the cityâ€™s blackouts amid Russian missile strikes. According to Borys Todurov, the surgeon who filmed the operation, it was already under way when the electricity supply was suddenly cut. He said: This is how we perform heart surgery today. European Union governments remain split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscowâ€™s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with more talks possible on Friday if positions converge. Reuters reports: The EU states failed to reach a deal on the price level for Russian sea-borne oil on Wednesday because a Group of Seven nations (G7) proposal for a cap of $65-70 per barrel was seen as far to high by some and too low by others. The European Commission, the Czech EU presidency, the United States and G7 presidency Germany were all engaged in talks on Thursday to bridge differences and reach a deal before the price cap is due to come into force on 5 December. Diplomats said that six of the EUâ€™s 27 countries opposed the price cap level proposed by the G7. Poland wants the cap to be set at $30, arguing that with Russian production costs that some estimate at $20 per barrel, the G7 proposal would allow Moscow too much profit. Lithuania and Estonia back Poland. Cyprus, Greece and Malta, countries with big shipping industries that stand to lose most if Russian oil cargoes are obstructed, argue the cap is too low and want compensation for the loss of business or more time to adjust. One EU diplomat said: There are a lot of bilateral talks going on now at very high levels. There will be a meeting of representatives of all EU countries once there is progress. There is no point in calling another meeting if there is no change. The first reactor of Ukraineâ€™s Khmelnytskyi nuclear plant has been reconnected to the countryâ€™s power grid, regional governor Serhiy Hamaliy said. The Khmelnytskyi plant disconnected from Ukraineâ€™s grid on Wednesday after Russian strikes on the countryâ€™s power system, Ukrainian officials said. Meanwhile, Russiaâ€™s Transneft said that pumping of oil through the Ukrainian section of the Druzhba pipeline had resumed at 6pm Moscow time, the TASS news agency reported, citing a company spokesperson. Hungaryâ€™s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said that Hungaryâ€™s parliament will ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Orban told a briefing after a meeting of the Visegrad Group in Slovakia that his government had already decided that Hungary would support Finlandâ€™s and Swedenâ€™s Nato accession and that the countryâ€™s parliament would set this item on its agenda at its first session next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. US President Joe Biden has confirmed that a price cap on Russian oil being proposed by the United States and its western allies is â€œin playâ€?, adding that he had spoken to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on the issue. He made his comments to reporters during a Thanksgiving holiday visit to a fire station on Nantucket Island. Reuters has the full detail on the prisoner of war swaps: Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow have confirmed. Russiaâ€™s defence ministry said Ukraine had released 50 Russian soldiers who had been captured. Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, said on Telegram that Ukraine received 48 soldiers and two officers, among them marines, infantrymen, border guards and members of the territorial defence. He said: We have managed to bring back 19 defenders of Mariupol ... as well as 15 prisoners (of war) from the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and seven from Zmiiny Island. Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-backed head of the part of Ukraineâ€™s Donetsk region that is under Russian control, said earlier that a prisoner swap with Kyiv was taking place, involving 50 prisoners on each side. Kyiv and Moscow have so far swapped over 1,000 prisoners of war since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine in February. The Ukraine Solidarity Project, a group of European and Ukrainian activists who target brands with ties to Russia, has unfurled a 400m2 banner outside energy drink company Red Bullâ€™s headquarters in Salzburg depicting Vladimir Putin riding the companyâ€™s famous bull logo. The banner reads â€œRed Bull gives Putin wingsâ€? in reference to the companyâ€™s decision not to pull its products from Russian supermarkets. Red Bull was given a failing D grade by the Yale School of Managementâ€™s Russia business policy ranking for having postponed future planned investment and marketing while continuing â€œsubstantive businessâ€? in Russia. The Ukraine Solidarity Project said: It really matters that Red Bull is still on sale in Russia. Itâ€™s one of the worldâ€™s biggest brands and its decision to stick with Putinâ€™s Russia is highly significant. Companies that sell their products there are paying taxes to the Kremlin and signalling that theyâ€™re comfortable with the illegal invasion of Ukraine. They need to pull out. As things stand, Red Bull gives Putin wings. Russiaâ€™s defence ministry has announced that Ukraine has released 50 Russian soldiers who had been captured, in the latest prisoner exchange between the two sides. Earlier today, the Russian-installed head of Ukraineâ€™s Donetsk region said Russia would also release 50 captured Ukrainians. Romania is willing to continue supplying neighbouring Moldova with electricity as Russian shelling in Ukraine hits its energy supply, but insufficient interconnections are a challenge, Romanian president Klaus Iohannis has said. â€œUp until now we have delivered everything we were asked for,â€? Iohannis told reporters after meeting Lithuaniaâ€™s president in Vilnius. â€œBut outages happen because â€¦ Romanian-Moldovan interconnections are completely insufficient. Most of the power Romania is offering passes through Ukraine.â€? Romanian power producers started selling electricity to Moldova at a capped price in October, Reuters reported. Romaniaâ€™s foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said earlier this week the EU state was providing between 80% and 90% of Moldovaâ€™s electricity needs. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. â€œRussiaâ€™s attacks on civilian infrastructure are an intolerable, inhumane crime. Putin may plunge the people of Ukraine into cold and darkness with his missiles. He will never break their will for freedom and our support,â€? she added. A meeting of Nato foreign ministers is scheduled to take place in Bucharest on Tuesday and Wednesday, Reuters reported. A G7 foreign ministers meeting held in Germany earlier this month on Baerbockâ€™s initiative focused on how to support Ukraine through the winter in the face of Russian attacks on its power grid. Ukrainian cities were plunged into darkness this week after a barrage of Russian missiles triggered one of the worst nationwide power outages of the war yet. Former German chancellor Angela Merkel said she had aimed to convene European talks with Vladimir Putin the year before his invasion of Ukraine but in the end did not see any possibility of influencing the Russian president at the end of her term. Merkel told the Spiegel news magazine in an interview published on Thursday that she and French president Emmanuel Macron had planned to hold an independent talk format with Putin within the European Council in 2021, her last summer in office. â€œBut I no longer had the strength to push through because, after all, everyone knew: sheâ€™s leaving in autumn,â€? she said. Merkel, who retired from politics after 16 years in power following Germanyâ€™s September 2021 election, officially handed over the reins to Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats in December that year, Reuters reported. US president Joe Biden met the Russian leader in June 2021. Referring to her farewell visit to Moscow in August 2021, Merkel, who speaks fluent Russian, told Spiegel: The feeling was very clear: â€˜In terms of power politics, youâ€™re through.â€™ For Putin, only power counts. The leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic have publicly criticised Hungaryâ€™s prime minister, Viktor OrbÃ¡n, over the war in Ukraine. Reuters reports: Unity within the Visegrad Group, set up in 1991 as the region emerged from decades of communist rule, has been sorely tested by the war, with OrbÃ¡n opposing harsher European sanctions on Russia including on energy supplies. By contrast, Hungaryâ€™s three Visegrad neighbours â€“ which also include Slovakia â€“ are among the EUâ€™s toughest critics of Russian president Vladimir Putinâ€™s actions in Ukraine. The Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, said as he headed for a meeting of Visegrad leaders in Slovakia on Thursday: This is not the best of times for the (Visegrad) format, and Hungaryâ€™s different attitudes are significantly influencing and complicating the situation. I make no secret of the fact that the views of the Hungarian prime minister, some of which can even be described as provocative, do not help this cooperation to proceed as well as in the past. This week OrbÃ¡n further annoyed his neighbours by wearing a scarf to a soccer match that depicted some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, prompting Kyiv to summon the Hungarian ambassador to lodge a protest. Fiala said on Wednesday the â€œGreater Hungaryâ€? scarf â€“ which also showed territory now in Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia and Serbia as part of Hungary â€“ would be discussed at Thursdayâ€™s summit gathering in the Slovak city of Kosice. Poland, an ally of Hungary in their past disputes with the EU over the rule of law and human rights, has also turned more critical of OrbÃ¡n because of his stance on Ukraine. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, criticised Hungaryâ€™s failure so far to ratify Sweden and Finlandâ€™s application to join Nato. He said: I will tell (OrbÃ¡n) directly that for Poland this is one of the most important changes in international law, that is the accession of Finland and Sweden. We canâ€™t allow the Visegrad Group to fall apart. It is a structure which protects the interests of our countries against other interest groups from western Europe. Russia risked causing a â€œnuclear and radioactive catastropheâ€? by launching attacks in which all Ukraineâ€™s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraineâ€™s nuclear energy chief has said. Reuters reports that Petro Kotin, head of nuclear power company Energoatom, said the vast nuclear power station in the Zaporizhzhia region of southern Ukraine, which has been out of commission since September, had also been disconnected from the grid on Wednesday and became reliant on backup diesel generators. He added that the Zaporizhzhia plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since soon after Russia invaded Ukraine nine months ago, had been reconnected to the grid by Thursday morning and that the backup generators were turned off. He said in a written statement: There is a real danger of a nuclear and radiation catastrophe being caused by firing on the entire territory of Ukraine with Russian cruise and ballistic missiles, and a huge risk of damage to nuclear plants. Russia must answer for this shameful crime. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. Each side has blamed the other for shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant complex. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraineâ€™s responsibility, and that if it does not â€œstopâ€?, it will end in the â€œcomplete destructionâ€? of the country. In a broadcast clip circulating on social media for its controversial comments, Lukashenko said that â€œeverything is in Ukraineâ€™s hands now if they donâ€™t want a huge number of people to dieâ€?. He said that similar to relations with Germany following the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded â€œwe will make it all upâ€?. Advisor to Ukraineâ€™s minister of internal affairs, Anton Gerashchenko, tweeted that this was â€œtheatre of [the] absurdâ€?. Hungary has obtained an exemption from the EUâ€™s proposed Russian oil price cap during talks in Brussels, according to the countryâ€™s foreign minister, PÃ©ter SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³. Szijjarto said at a briefing in Brussels broadcast on his Facebook page that the European Unionâ€™s current proposal says that oil deliveries though pipelines would be exempt from the price cap, which means it would not affect Hungary if the proposed cap is adopted later. A snap from Reuters suggests that Russia and Ukraine will each exchange 50 prisoners of war today, according to the Russian-installed leader in Ukraineâ€™s Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, who posted on the Telegram messaging service. More details to follow. Russia does not plan to supply oil to countries supporting a price cap on Russian oil, the Kremlin has said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said that Ukraineâ€™s leadership could â€œend sufferingâ€? in Ukraine by meeting Russiaâ€™s demands to resolve the conflict. Peskov was asked whether Russia was worried about the effect on the civilian population of its strikes on energy infrastructure, which have caused repeated mass blackouts. Peskov said Russia attacked targets of military, not â€œsocialâ€?, relevance. Rachel Hall here taking over the blog for the next few hours. If thereâ€™s anything weâ€™ve missed, do drop me a line at rachel.hall@theguardian.com. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the dayâ€™s headlines so far: Ukraine expects three nuclear power plants that were switched off because of Russian missile strikes on Wednesday will be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. â€œWe expect that by evening the nuclear power plants will start working, providing energy to the network, and this will significantly reduce the [energy] deficit,â€? he said in comments broadcast on national television. More than two-thirds of the Ukrainian capital was still without power on Thursday morning and a number of residents had no running water, a day after Russian missile strikes caused Kyivâ€™s biggest outages in nine months of war. The capital was one of the main targets of the latest wave of attacks on energy facilities that cut power in many regions and made emergency blackouts necessary in others to conserve energy and enable repairs as winter sets in. Representatives from Russia and Ukraine met in the United Arab Emirates last week to discuss the possibility of a prisoner-of-war swap, according to a Reuters report. Any swap would be linked to a resumption of Russian ammonia exports, which go to Asia and Africa, via a Ukrainian pipeline, three sources with knowledge of the meeting told the news agency. Russiaâ€™s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said contacts with the UN nuclear watchdog over safety at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine were â€œconstructiveâ€? and showed some promise. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling last weekend, prompting renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster. Russia is not planning contact with the United States and did not initiate contact with Washington at the G20 summit in Indonesia, the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Thursday. He added that contacts with Washington happen over the phone but take place through diplomatic channels and not at a presidential level. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014, Reuters reports. Ukraineâ€™s general staff said Russian forces tried again to make advances on their main targets in the Donetsk region - Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Russian forces shelled both areas and used incendiary devices to set Ukrainian positions ablaze with only limited success, the general staff said. Russiaâ€™s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the â€œSouth Streamâ€? gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported. The pipeline was a project intended to transport Russian gas through the Black Sea to Bulgaria, although was later cancelled in favour of TurkStream. Polish leaders say that an air defence system which Germany offered Poland would be best given to Ukraine to help it protect itself against Russian strikes. Germany said earlier this week that it has offered Warsaw Eurofighter planes and Patriot defence systems to help defend Polandâ€™s airspace after two men were killed when an apparently stray Ukrainian defence projectile fell in Poland near the border with Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. Hungary will provide â‚¬187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to â‚¬18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. Prime minister Viktor OrbÃ¡nâ€™s government has said it was willing to pay its share of support for Ukraine but would rather pay it bilaterally than through the EUâ€™s joint borrowing, Reuters reported. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations security council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that have again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Russia unleashed a missile barrage across Ukraine on Wednesday, killing 10 people, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and cutting water and electricity supply in many places. Neighbouring Moldova said it was suffering massive blackouts caused by the missile barrage and its EU-friendly president, Maia Sandu, accused Russia of leaving her country â€œin the darkâ€?. European Union governments failed to reach a deal on Wednesday on the level at which to cap prices for Russian sea-borne oil under the G7 scheme and will resume talks, EU diplomats said. Earlier on Thursday, EU representatives met in Brussels. The move is part of sanctions intended to slash Moscowâ€™s revenue from its oil exports so it has less money to finance the invasion of Ukraine. The resignation of Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Unesco will end the deadlock in a key group he chaired that is charged with preserving cultural sites around the world, a diplomatic source told AFP. The World Heritage Committee, responsible for adding properties to Unescoâ€™s list of world heritage sites, had been unable to function for months after the international backlash against Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraineâ€™s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. Thatâ€™s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Rachel Hall will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russiaâ€™s war on Ukraine. Polish leaders say that an air defence system which Germany offered Poland would be best given to Ukraine to help it protect itself against Russian strikes. Germany said earlier this week that it has offered Warsaw Eurofighter planes and Patriot defence systems to help defend Polandâ€™s airspace after two men were killed when an apparently stray Ukrainian defence projectile fell in Poland near the border with Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. Polandâ€™s defence minister, Mariusz BÅ‚aszczak, initially said he received Germanyâ€™s offer with â€œsatisfactionâ€?. But following Russiaâ€™s heavy barrage of Ukraine on Wednesday, Polish leaders said it would be better if the defence systems were placed in western Ukraine. The head of Polandâ€™s ruling party, JarosÅ‚aw KaczyÅ„ski, called Germanyâ€™s offer â€œinterestingâ€? but said he believed â€œit would be best for Polandâ€™s security if Germany handed the equipment to the Ukrainians, trained Ukrainian teams, with the caveat that the batteries would be placed in Ukraineâ€™s westâ€?. Ukraineâ€™s ambassador to Warsaw, Vasyl Zvarych, thanked BÅ‚aszczak, saying on Twitter that Ukraine needs as many air defence weapons as it can get. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscowâ€™s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. â€œWe are working hard to hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine and I can announce today that we are working full speed on a 9th sanctions package,â€? von der Leyen told a news conference. â€œAnd Iâ€™m confident that we will very soon approve a global price cap on Russian oil with the G7 and other major partners. We will not rest until Ukraine has prevailed over Putin and his unlawful and barbaric war,â€? she said. Russia is not planning contact with the United States and did not initiate contact with Washington at the G20 summit in Indonesia, the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Thursday. He added that contacts with Washington happen over the phone but take place through diplomatic channels and not at a presidential level. Meanwhile, Russiaâ€™s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the â€œSouth Streamâ€? gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported. The pipeline was a project intended to transport Russian gas through the Black Sea to Bulgaria, although was later cancelled in favour of TurkStream. Representatives from Russia and Ukraine met in the United Arab Emirates last week to discuss the possibility of a prisoner-of-war swap, according to a Reuters report. Any swap would be linked to a resumption of Russian ammonia exports, which go to Asia and Africa, via a Ukrainian pipeline, three sources with knowledge of the meeting told the news agency. Reuters reported: The sources said the talks were being mediated by the Gulf Arab state and did not include the United Nations despite the UNâ€™s central role in negotiating the ongoing initiative to export agricultural products from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Ammonia is used to make fertiliser. However, the talks aim to remove remaining obstacles in the initiative extended last week and ease global food shortages by unblocking Ukrainian and Russian exports, they added. The sources asked not to be named in order to freely discuss sensitive matters. The Russian and Ukrainian representatives travelled to the UAE capital Abu Dhabi on 17 November where they discussed allowing Russia to resume ammonia exports in exchange for a prisoner swap that would release a large number of Ukrainian and Russian prisoners, the sources said. Reuters could not immediately establish what progress was made at the talks. Russiaâ€™s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said contacts with the UN nuclear watchdog over safety at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine were â€œconstructiveâ€? and showed some promise. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling last weekend, prompting renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the plant, which both Ukraine and Moscow have accused each other of shelling, Reuters reported. Hungary will provide â‚¬187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to â‚¬18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. Prime minister Viktor OrbÃ¡nâ€™s government has said it was willing to pay its share of support for Ukraine but would rather pay it bilaterally than through the EUâ€™s joint borrowing, Reuters reported. â€œThe government continues to be committed to take part in financial support to war-gripped Ukraine,â€? the government said in the decree. â€œSo it calls on the finance minister to make sure to provide the â‚¬187m that would be Hungaryâ€™s share in the â‚¬18bn EU loan to be granted to Ukraine.â€? The decree, signed by OrbÃ¡n, also says that the Hungarian foreign minister, PÃ©ter SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³, should start talks with Ukraine to work out an agreement needed for the financial assistance. To secure the funds for the loans, which Ukraine will have to repay within 35 years, the European Commission would borrow on the capital markets. However, proposals for the package will need to be approved by the European parliament and the EUâ€™s 27 member states and Hungary said it would not take part in joint borrowing. Ukraine expects three nuclear power plants that were switched off because of Russian missile strikes on Wednesday will be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. â€œWe expect that by evening the nuclear power plants will start working, providing energy to the network, and this will significantly reduce the [energy] deficit,â€? he said in comments broadcast on national television. More than two-thirds of the Ukrainian capital was still without power on Thursday morning and a number of residents had no running water, a day after Russian missile strikes caused Kyivâ€™s biggest outages in nine months of war. The capital was one of the main targets of the latest wave of attacks on energy facilities that cut power in many regions and made emergency blackouts necessary in others to conserve energy and enable repairs as winter sets in. The temperature plunged below zero degrees Celsius overnight in a city that had 2.8 million residents before the war and where it is already snowing and the streets are icy, Reuters reported. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said electricians and repair workers were doing everything to get the power back on â€œas fast as possibleâ€? but the recovery would depend largely on the overall energy â€œbalanceâ€? of the nationwide grid. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy chief of president Volodymyr Zelenskiyâ€™s staff, said power supplies had been restored in the Kirovohrad and Vinnytsia regions. In the south, the Mykolaiv regionâ€™s governor, Vitaliy Kim, appealed to Ukrainians to be as frugal as possible in their use of power. â€œConsumption has been growing this morning [which is logical], there isnâ€™t enough capacity in the system to switch it on for more consumers!!,â€? he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. â€œThe energy system is united like we all are! If youâ€™ve turned off a few unneeded lights, thatâ€™s really important!!!â€? Ukrainian servicemen shoot towards Russian positions on the frontline near Kherson, southern Ukraine. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014, Reuters reports. Ukraineâ€™s general staff said Russian forces tried again to make advances on their main targets in the Donetsk region - Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Russian forces shelled both areas and used incendiary devices to set Ukrainian positions ablaze with only limited success, the general staff said. Among those fighting the Russians in Bakhmut are a unit of Chechen fighters, who hope a Ukrainian victory could spark political crisis in Russia and bring down the powerful pro-Moscow leader of Chechnya. Further south, Russian forces were digging in on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, the general staff said, shelling areas on the west bank including the town of Kherson, which was recently reclaimed by Ukrainian forces. Reuters was not able to immediately verify the battlefield accounts. The resignation of Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Unesco will end the deadlock in a key group he chaired that is charged with preserving cultural sites around the world, a diplomatic source told AFP. The World Heritage Committee, responsible for adding properties to Unescoâ€™s list of world heritage sites, had been unable to function for months after the international backlash against Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. â€œI have the honor to inform you of the end of my mission as permanent delegate of the Russian Federation to Unesco,â€? Russian ambassador Alexander Kuznetsov said on Tuesday in a letter to the members of the World Heritage Committee obtained by AFP. The resignation will allow the committee to â€œquickly appoint a new presidentâ€? and resume its activities, a UN diplomat told AFP. Russiaâ€™s position as chair of the committee had sparked an outcry among other members following Moscowâ€™s invasion of Ukraine in February. The committee had been due to meet in June in the Russian city of Kazan, but 46 countries, including France and the UK, boycotted the event. The meeting was supposed to update the landscapes, monuments and cities included in the bodyâ€™s list of heritage sites. Unesco regulations dictate that replacements for a resigning committee chair are to be appointed by the country that follows in alphabetical order in English. On Wednesday, Ukraineâ€™s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. The countryâ€™s energy ministry said supplies were cut to â€œthe vast majority of electricity consumersâ€?. All of Kyiv lost water, the capitalâ€™s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. The cityâ€™s administration said water and heating would return to residential buildings on Thursday morning. Late Wednesday, the deputy head of Ukraineâ€™s presidential office said that Kyiv and over a dozen regions, including Lviv and Odesa in the south, had been reconnected to the power grid. Klitschko said 21 out of 31 missiles targeting Kyiv were shot down before they reached their targets. One of the 10 that evaded the defences hit an apartment block in Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of the city, killing three people and wounding 15. There was a kindergarten in the lower ground floor of the building, but it was evacuated after air raid sirens went off. The blast left a three-metre crater in front of the building, destroyed apartments around it, blew the tops off nearby trees and ruined a childrenâ€™s playground. Earlier in the day, a newborn baby was killed when a Russian rocket struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraineâ€™s state emergency service said a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor were in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, when it was hit. The mother and the doctor were pulled alive from the rubble by rescue workers but the baby died, it said on the Telegram messaging app. Lorenzo Tondo and Julian Borger report from Kyiv: Fresh Russian strikes battered Ukraineâ€™s already failing electricity grid, causing blackouts across the country and in neighbouring Moldova, in attacks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the UN were â€œan obvious crime against humanityâ€?. Addressing an urgent meeting of the UN security council late on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine would put forward a resolution condemning â€œany forms of energy terrorâ€?. Referring to Russiaâ€™s likely veto, he said: â€œItâ€™s nonsense that the veto right is secured for the party that wages this war. â€œWe cannot be hostage to one international terrorist,â€? Zelenskiy said. He also invited the UN to send experts to examine and evaluate Ukraineâ€™s critical infrastructure. â€œWhen we have the temperature below zero, and scores of millions of people without energy supplies, without heating, without water, this is an obvious crime against humanity,â€? Zelenskiy told the security council via video link: Hello, my name is Helen Sullivan and youâ€™re reading the Guardianâ€™s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. On Wednesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations Security Council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Russia unleashed a missile barrage across Ukraine on Wednesday, killing 10 people, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and cutting water and electricity supply in many places. â€œToday is just one day, but we have received 70 missiles. Thatâ€™s the Russian formula of terror. This is all against our energy infrastructure... Hospitals, schools, transport, residential districts all suffered,â€? Zelenskiy said via video link to the council chamber. At least 10 people were killed in the strikes, Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said, including a two-day-old infant.

Earlier on Thursday, EU representatives met in Brussels. The move is part of sanctions intended to slash Moscowâ€™s revenue from its oil exports so it has less money to finance the invasion of Ukraine. UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the UN security council on Wednesday that an exchange of 35 Russian and 36 Ukrainian prisoners was a positive development amid the â€œdark newsâ€? of Russian strikes on Ukraine. DiCarlo encouraged the parties to continue prisoner releases and follow international humanitarian law in relation to prisoners of war, Reuters reports. A Russian court on Wednesday extended by six months the detention of opposition politician Ilya Yashin, who risks being jailed for 10 years for denouncing president Vladimir Putinâ€™s assault on Ukraine. The 39-year-old Moscow city councillor is in the dock as part of an unprecedented crackdown on dissent in Russia, with most opposition activists either in jail or in exile. He faces up to 10 years behind bars, if convicted. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had faith in the â€œsuccessâ€? of its offensive in Ukraine. â€œThe future and the success of the special operation are beyond doubt,â€? the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on a visit to Armenia, using the official Moscow term to describe Russiaâ€™s assault, Agence France-Presse reports.

The attacks struck a wide arc of targets including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraineâ€™s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones.</strong> It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Kyivâ€™s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way.</strong> Two people were injured. â€œAfter the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capitalâ€™s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,â€? he said on Telegram.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Maksym Kozytskyi</strong>, the governor of <strong>Lviv</strong>, reported five people had been killed in a strike on the <strong>Zolochiv</strong> district. <strong>Oleh Synyehubov</strong>, governor of <strong>Kharkiv</strong>, said two women in their 70s had been injured by a strike on <strong>Pisochyn</strong>. Ukraineâ€™s presidential chief of staff, <strong>Andriy Yermak</strong>, reported that three people were killed in the southern city of <strong>Kherson</strong>.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. </strong>â€œToday, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for ten days,â€? the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. It took two weeks for power to be restored.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister, <strong>Dmytro Kuleba</strong>, has described the overnight strikes as without military purpose and â€œjust Russian barbarismâ€?.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Russian foreign minister <strong>Sergei Lavrov</strong> said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia was among the countries that had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Russiaâ€™s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in <strong>Moldova</strong>â€™s breakaway region of <strong>Transnistria</strong> claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, <strong>Vadim Krasnoselsky</strong>.

Itâ€™s infrastructure well beyond Russia and Ukraine, so it triggered a lot of anxiety about the security of other assets. It makes the war uncomfortably close.â€?</p> \n   <p>If any country with a stake in the region were proven responsible, that would have significant consequences of its own. If the US or a Nato or EU country was behind the attack, that would cause a serious rift in the western alliance in support of Ukraine.</p> \n   <p>If Ukraine did it, fears that Kyiv was acting recklessly would probably diminish their support in Europe and the US â€“ particularly, for obvious reasons, in Germany.</p> \n   <p>And evidence of Moscowâ€™s culpability â€œwould be a new frontier in Russian aggression,â€? Sabbagh said. While a Russian act of sabotage on a Russian-owned piece of infrastructure would not clearly amount to an act of war, the material damage to future gas supplies â€œwould further unite the west against Putinâ€?.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>You can read more of that analysis here: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/09/thursday-briefing-the-mystery-of-the-nord-stream-sabotage-and-who-may-be-responsible\">The mystery of the Nord Stream sabotage â€“ and who may be responsible</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/09/thursday-briefing-the-mystery-of-the-nord-stream-sabotage-and-who-may-be-responsible\">Thursday briefing: The mystery of the Nord Stream sabotage â€“ and who may be responsible</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-03-09T11:07:15.156Z\">at 11.07am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6409aeef8f088ed9e3365690\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-03-09T10:03:54.799Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ukraine will take part in European Union countriesâ€™ scheme to jointly buy gas, the blocâ€™s energy policy chief said on Thursday.</strong></p> \n  <p>â€œWe have integrated Ukraine in the gas joint purchasing platform with a view to help secure 2bn cubic metres of additional gas,â€?

In the meantime here are the key recent developments in the war:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The city of Bakhmut, in Ukraineâ€™s east, could fall in the next few days, said Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. </strong>â€œWhat we see is that Russia is throwing more troops, more forces and what Russia lacks in quality they try to make up in quantity. They have suffered big losses, but at the same time, we cannot rule out that Bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming days,â€? he said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The founder of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin,</strong> which has been leading the Russian assault on Bakhmut, has said Russian forces now fully control the east of the city. The claims have not been independently verified. The General Staff of Ukraineâ€™s armed forces said in its Wednesday morning report: â€œThe enemy, despite significant losses, continues to storm the town of Bakhmut.â€?</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia is unlikely to capture significantly more territory this year, according to the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines. </strong>She told a Senate hearing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/russia-ukraine-us-intelligence-chief-avril-haines\">the military will probably be unable to carry on its current level of fighting</a>, even with the possible capture of Bakhmut.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Pentagon has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/pentagon-international-criminal-court-russia-war-crimes\">blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC)</a></strong> about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The defence department is said to be firmly opposed to using the Hague-based ICC, as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has invited top US house speaker Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine</strong> as doubts over support for Kyivâ€™s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelensky proposed the visit in an interview with CNN.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Zelensky has also called for â€œdemocratic successâ€? in Georgia</strong> where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/georgia-opposition-protests-tbilisi-law-parliament\">thousands of protesters have rallied for a second day</a>, against a controversial â€œforeign agentâ€? bill, reminiscent of Russian legislation used to silence critics. â€œThere is no Ukrainian who would not wish success to our friendly Georgia. Democratic success. European success,â€? he said in his evening address to the nation.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The US obtained a warrant to seize a Boeing aircraft owned by Russian oil company Rosneft that is valued at over $25m,</strong> the Justice Department said. The District Court for the Eastern District of New York authorised the seizure, based on violations of export controls and sanctions against Russia, the Justice Department said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>In a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, UN secretary general, AntÃ³nio Guterres, told journalists it was â€œcriticalâ€? that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> across the Black Sea be renewed,</strong> with Ukraine traditionally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/ukraine-and-un-chief-call-for-new-grain-deal-to-safeguard-global-food-supplies\">being one of the worldâ€™s largest exporters of grain.</a> A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Wednesday he had suggested the bloc spend â‚¬1bn for the joint procurement of ammunition for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> and to refill their own stockpiles. </strong>â€œI propose to mobilise another â‚¬1bn,â€? Reuters reported he told the media after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Stockholm.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg said that it was still uncertain who carried out the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year, </strong>and that national investigations needed to be allowed to finish.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>German officials announced that they searched a ship in January</strong> that they believe many have been used to transport explosives used in the sabotage.

Rafael Grossi, the head of the UNâ€™s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the siteâ€™s safety and security. Russian missile strikes across Ukraine while people slept on Thursday killed at least six civilians, knocking out electricity and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Ukraineâ€™s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Russiaâ€™s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldovaâ€™s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistriaâ€™s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. AFP reports Lithuaniaâ€™s military intelligence service on Thursday said it estimated that Russia had enough resources to wage two more years of war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has reportedly been snubbed by the Oscars for the second year in a row. Reuters reports that Ukraine will take part in the European Union scheme to jointly buy gas in global markets, to procure 2 billion cubic metres of the fuel ahead of next winter, the EU energy policy chief said on Thursday. A close ally of Alexei Navalny has resigned his post at the opposition leaderâ€™s Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF) after it was revealed that he had signed letters calling for the EU to drop sanctions against several UK-based Russian billionaire oligarchs. Leonid Volkov confirmed he had signed and sent a 2022 letter to Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, in which he called for Brussels to relax sanctions on Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and business partners German Khan and Alexei Kuzmichev, in a scandal marked by infighting among Russiaâ€™s contentious liberal and opposition circles. â€œThis letter was a big political mistake,â€? wrote Volkov in a post on Thursday where he uploaded the October 2022 letter to Borrell. â€œWorse, by doing this, I exceeded my authority â€“ I signed it not in my personal capacity, but on behalf of the organisation. I did not inform my colleagues, and, therefore, I also put them [on the letter].â€? Volkov said he would resign from ACF Internationalâ€™s board and â€œtake a break from my public socio-political activityâ€?. The organisation had earlier published a list of 6,000 â€œbribetakers and warmongersâ€? it said should be issued with sanctions by western countries. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has expressed concern over the recent power outage at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. On Thursday, power to the Russian-occupied plant was lost during Russian air strikes. During a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of directors held in Vienna, Rafael Grossi criticised the organisationâ€™s complacency in preventing such incidents from happening, noting that its primary role was to ensure nuclear safety. â€˜What are we doing to prevent this happening? We are the IAEA, we are meant to care about nuclear safety,â€™ Grossi told its board of directors in a meeting on Thursday in Vienna. â€˜Each time we are rolling a dice,â€™ he said. You can watch the video here: The German chancellor has said that Putin has shown no willingness to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Speaking to a group of German reporters, Scholz said: â€œUnfortunately, I see no willingness at the moment,â€? Scholz was quoted by NBR as saying, adding Ukraine must decide what conditions it is ready to accept for peace. Scholz said that energy supply in Europeâ€™s biggest economy would be sufficient next winter and that the German economy was heading for growth rates last seen in the 1950s and 1960s due to heavy investment in climate protection. Reuters has reported that Russia has introduced personal sanctions against 144 government officials, journalists, lawmakers and other public figures from the three Baltic states who are deemed â€œmost hostileâ€? to Moscow. Reuters reports: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - ruled from Moscow during the Cold War but now members of the European Union and NATO - have been among the strongest critics of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. The ministry said the move was a response to what it called active lobbying by the three Baltic republics for more sanctions against Russia and to their â€œinterference in our internal affairs, inciting Russophobic sentimentsâ€?. Last year, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania began restricting the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus in response to what Moscow calls its â€œspecial military operationâ€? in Ukraine. AFP reports Lithuaniaâ€™s military intelligence service on Thursday said it estimated that Russia had enough resources to wage two more years of war in Ukraine. You can read the full report below: â€œRussia had been accumulating weapons and equipment over the long years of the Cold War,â€? military intelligence chief Elegijus Paulavicius told reporters. â€œWe estimate that (its) resources would last for another two years of a war of the same intensity as today,â€? he added. He noted that the assessment depended on the perspective that no foreign country would provide military aid to Moscow. Russia has a large amount of weaponry stored in its reserves, which would allow them to â€œcause enormous damage and increase the costs of restoration,â€? he said. He spoke alongside his counterpart from civilian intelligence at a presentation of their annual report. Beyond estimates of Russian resources, the report also suggested that Russiaâ€™s mobilisation last year showed that support for the war in Ukraine â€œis not as big as the regimeâ€™s propaganda tried to make it seemâ€?. â€œDissatisfaction with the regimeâ€™s policies is currently taking a passive form: mostly avoiding mobilisation, complaining about poor provision and disarray in the army,â€? the document said. It also raised the possibility that Russiaâ€™s failures on the battlefield, further mobilisation and a sudden deterioration of the economic situation â€œwould have negative consequences for the stability of the regimeâ€?. Lithuania, a member of both the European Union and NATO, has been a major backer of Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February last year. Serhii Andrushko, a Ukrainian reporter, has said that his countryâ€™s struggle for freedom also includes another kind of war - against high-level corruption - which experts think could have more success now as Kyiv strives for European Union membership. Reuters reports: Last month, the Radio Liberty correspondent confronted candidates on camera vying to become Kyivâ€™s next top anti-corruption official about their personal finances and political ties. That might seem less urgent when soldiers are dying every day, but part of Ukraineâ€™s battle includes shedding any perceived similarities to Russia. â€œParticularly its attitude to corruption,â€? Andrushko said. According to Transparency Internationalâ€™s 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine ranked slightly better than Russia but still well below the global average. So reporters like Andrushko say they are working to keep their rulers honest, a job some experts and media insiders said could have more impact now that Kyiv is under pressure to prove it can clean up its act as it seeks membership in the European Union. They said a major political shake-up seen earlier this year, when more than a dozen officials were dismissed amid a flurry of critical domestic press coverage, could be a taste of things to come if Ukraineâ€™s investigative journalists continue. Their focus also shows civil society is embracing its role as a government watchdog even as the war grinds on. â€œMedia are becoming more influential because theyâ€™re appealing to the more acute sense of justice among citizens,â€? said researcher Petro Burkovskyy, of the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation think-tank. They will need to choose stories wisely and back up their reporting, he added, since being sloppy or overly critical can invite public scepticism or even accusations of being unpatriotic. Many journalists are also turning their attention to uncovering Russian war crimes and assets in Ukraine. Here is some more detailed reporting on Ukraineâ€™s national grid being reconnected to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station today. Reuters reports: Back-up diesel generators - a last line of defence to prevent meltdown from overheating reactor fuel - kicked in after external power was lost to the plant early on Thursday, but they have only enough fuel to power it for 10 days. Ukraine blamed Russia for the loss of power to the plant in southeastern Ukraine. Officials in the part of the Zaporizhzhia region which is occupied by Russia called it a â€œprovocationâ€? by Kyiv. The incident renewed fears of an accident at Europeâ€™s largest atomic power station, nearly four decades after the Chornobyl nuclear disaster, but national grid operator Ukrenergo signalled that repairs had been carried out quickly. â€œSpecialists of â€˜Ukrenergoâ€™ have restored the power supply of the Zaporizhzhia NPP (nuclear power plant), which was interrupted by todayâ€™s missile strikes,â€? it said in a statement. â€œThe ZNPP is switching from diesel generators to receiving electricity for its own needs from the unified energy system of Ukraine.â€? Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of compromising safety by shelling the site of the plant, forcing power cuts during air strikes and flouting safety measures. Russia has denied shelling the site, and has accused Ukraine of being behind the shelling. â€œThe risks of disaster at the Zaporizhzhia NPP are significantly increasing, and our ability to react to them, to avoid them are significantly decreasing,â€? Oleh Korikov, acting chairman of the Ukrainian state nuclear safety watchdog, told a news briefing on Thursday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nationsâ€™ nuclear watchdog, also expressed alarm after confirming the back-up generators had kicked in. Calling for a protection zone around the plant, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told the watchdogâ€™s Board of Governors: â€œEach time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out.â€? IAEA monitors are currently on site and Grossi has been pressing both sides to establish a demilitarised â€œsafe zoneâ€? around the station. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has reportedly been snubbed by the Oscars for the second year in a row. According to Variety, Zelenskiy had been hoping to appear on this Sundayâ€™s telecast following on from previous cultural appearances but the request has been denied. In the past year, the comedian turned politician has appeared via satellite during the Grammy awards and Golden Globes and within film festivals such as Cannes and most recently Berlin. Last month marked the one year anniversary of Russia invading Ukraine. Zelenskiy had secured Mike Simpson, a top power agent at major agency WME, after his client Aaron Kaufman co-directed Ukraine documentary Superpower made with Sean Penn, who loaned one of his two Oscars to Zelenskiy last year. The actor called it â€œa symbolic silly thingâ€? but after Ukraine wins the war against Russia, he could bring it back to him. He had previously promised to smelt an Oscar if the Academy didnâ€™t let him speak. â€œThere is nothing greater that the Academy Awards could do than to give [Zelensky] an opportunity to talk to all of us,â€? he said. Reuters reports that Ukraine will take part in the European Union scheme to jointly buy gas in global markets, to procure 2 billion cubic metres of the fuel ahead of next winter, the EU energy policy chief said on Thursday. EU countries plan to pool demand and sign their first joint gas contracts in the coming months, to help fill storage caverns ahead of peak winter demand as Europe replaces Russian gas. â€œUkraine has indicated that on top of their own domestic production, they might need, for a secure winter, another 2 billion cubic metres,â€? EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson told a news conference on Thursday. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic, who leads the EUâ€™s joint gas-buying, held a video call with international gas suppliers on Wednesday. Sefcovic said Europe was on track to expand its capacity to regasify liquefied natural gas to 227 billion cubic metres by 2024, up from 178 bcm now, as countries swap Russian gas for other supplies. Participating in the EU scheme could help Ukraine to stave off gas shortages. Of the 27.3 bcm of gas Ukraine used in 2021, domestic production accounted for about 19.8 bcm, imports were 2.6 bcm and 4.9 bcm of gas was taken from underground storage. Initial estimates from state-owned energy firm Naftogaz suggest Ukrainian gas production was around 18 bcm in 2022. Ukraine uses little gas to produce electricity, but relies on the fuel for heating and industry - sectors vulnerable should Russian strikes damage infrastructure. Ukraine does not import gas directly from Russia, but Ukrainian pipelines still carry some Russian gas to Europe. Russia has bombarded Ukraineâ€™s energy infrastructure in recent months, and on Thursday launched missile strikes across Ukraine, killing at least six civilians and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Kadri Simson said she would convene an emergency video call with Ukraine and EU energy ministers on Thursday to discuss the situation at Ukraineâ€™s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europeâ€™s largest, after Kyiv said Russian attacks had severed the plant from the power grid and forced it onto emergency diesel power. Russian strikes hit targets across a sleeping Ukraine early on Thursday. The capital, Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, were some of the places struck by a barrage of missiles, knocking out power to several areas. Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv and the strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Thursday that the European Union is completely ignoring any talks on the need to carry out an investigation of the Nord Stream gas pipeline blasts, Reuters reports. Russia has repeatedly asked to be allowed to join the investigations into the blasts, which ruptured three of the four pipelines of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas links that connect Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. Earlier today the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described it as â€œincomprehensibleâ€? that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Suspilne, Ukraineâ€™s state broadcaster, reports that the south command of the Ukrainian armed forces has claimed to have destroyed a Russian self-propelled artillery installation on the Kinburn spit. The claim has not been independently verified. The Kinburn spit is a stretch of land that stretches out from Kherson oblast to the west, and is opposite the southern coast of Ukraine that runs from Odesa to Mykolaiv. It is currently occupied by Russian forces. Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine that Russia partially occupies and claims to have annexed. Petr Pavel, a former Czech army chief and high-level Nato official, took the oath of office to start his five-year term as Czech president on Thursday. Pavel beat populist former prime minister Andrej BabiÅ¡ in a January election on pledges to firmly anchor the central European country in the European Union and Nato, a turn away from the policy of predecessor MiloÅ¡ Zeman, who had tried to boost relations with Russia and China. Pavel, a social liberal who campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, has tried to convey a message of unity after the divisive Zeman, who retired after 10 years in office on Wednesday. Reuters reports Czech presidents do not have many day-to-day duties, but they pick prime ministers and central bank heads, have a say in foreign policy, are powerful opinion makers, and can push the government on policies. Pavel has fully supported continued aid for Ukraine in its defence against Russiaâ€™s invasion. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southeastern Ukraine was reconnected to Ukraineâ€™s energy grid on Thursday, Ukrainian grid operator Ukrenergo said. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian state nuclear energy company Energoatom had said earlier on Thursday that power to the Russian-occupied plant was lost during Russian air strikes. Speaking to the BBC, the Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun said she believed that Russiaâ€™s latest assault on the country was an attempt to make citizens feel as though the country was â€œnot safeâ€? to continue living in. Sovsun added that she thought the primary purpose of the attacks was to â€œmake sure everybody feels scaredâ€? after a period of relative safety in the countryâ€™s capital, Kyiv. Reuters reports that local security services in the Moscow-backed breakaway Transnistria region of Moldova said on they had thwarted a Ukrainian assassination attempt against the regionâ€™s leader, according to Russian state news agencies reported. Reuters reports: Kyiv rejected the claims as a Kremlin â€œprovocationâ€?, the latest in a series of allegations, claims and counterclaims over escalating tensions in the territory, wedged along Ukraineâ€™s south-western border with Moldova. It was not immediately clear whether the Transnistrian officials had provided evidence to support their claim. â€œThe ministry of state security informs about the prevention of a terrorist attack. On the instructions of the Security Service of Ukraine, a crime was being prepared against a number of officials. The suspects have been detained,â€? the Russian state-run Tass news agency quoted the ministry as saying. In response, the Security Service of Ukraine said in a statement that the accusation â€œshould be considered exclusively as a provocation orchestrated by the Kremlinâ€?. It added: â€œLies and provocations are the weapons (Russia) actively uses. But today the entire world sees the true face of the aggressor country and does not believe the statements of Russia or its satellites.â€? Transnistria, a mainly Russian-speaking territory which borders Ukraine, broke from Moldovaâ€™s control in 1990, a year before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and is dependent on Russian support. Its allegiance to Moscow and location on Ukraineâ€™s western border have been a constant cause of concern since Russia invaded that the war could spread to the region. Last month, Russia accused Ukraine of planning to invade Transnistria after staging a â€˜false flagâ€™ operation there, a claim Kyiv denied. Moldova also rejected Russiaâ€™s claim. Moscow also said it would view as an attack on itself any actions that threatened Russian peacekeepers stationed in Transnistria. In a statement this morning about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Rafael Grossi, the head of the UNâ€™s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the siteâ€™s safety and security. He said: â€œThis is the sixth time â€“ let me say it again sixth time, that ZNPP has lost all off-site power and has had to operate in this emergency mode. Let me remind you - this is the largest nuclear power station in Europe.â€? He added: â€œWhat are we doing? How can we sit here in this room this morning and allow this to happen? This cannot go on. I am astonished by the complacency. What are we doing to prevent this from happening? Each time we are rolling a dice, and if we allow this to continue then one day our luck will run outâ€?. You can read an explainer regarding the significance of the power plant here: The South Korean company Hyundai Motor Co is in talks with a Kazakhstan company over the sale of its manufacturing plant in Russia, it has been reported. Reuters reports: Many factories in Russia have suspended production and furloughed workers due to shortages of hi-tech equipment because of sanctions and an exodus of western manufacturers since Moscow invaded Ukraine last year. The local government in St Petersburg has been negotiating with Kazakhstan to sell Hyundaiâ€™s Russia plant, Yonhap news agency reported, citing a Tass report. Yonhap reported that negotiations to sell Hyundaiâ€™s plant in St Petersburg to an auto-related company in Astana, Kazakhstan, are in the final stage, citing an unnamed source. The deal could be signed as early as June, it said. Hyundai suspended operations at its Russian factory last March. Hyundai was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. Intense fighting has continued in and around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. The below graphic shows the Russian military advances within the region. A residential building in Lviv oblast has been targeted by Russian missiles. Maksym Kozytskyy, the head of the Lviv oblast administration, released drone footage showing the aftermath of the attack on Thursday. A fifth person had died in overnight strikes, the governor said. Reuters has reported more details on the Russian missile strikes across Ukraine while people slept on Thursday, killing at least six civilians, knocking out electricity and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Reuters reports: The first big volley of missile strikes since mid-February shattered the longest period of comparative calm since Moscow began a campaign to attack Ukraineâ€™s civil infrastructure five months ago. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions had been hit. â€œThe occupiers can only terrorise civilians. Thatâ€™s all they can do. But it wonâ€™t help them. They wonâ€™t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,â€? Zelenskiy said in a statement. At least five people were killed in a missile that destroyed a village house in the western Lviv region, according to emergency services. Drone footage from the area, some 700 km (440 miles) from any military battlefield, showed a flattened home surrounded by badly damaged buildings. Another civilian was reported killed by the missiles in the central Dnipro region. Three civilians were separately reported killed by artillery in Kherson. In the capital Kyiv, residents were awakened by explosions. A seven-hour air strike alert through the night was the longest of the Russian air campaign that began in October. â€œI heard a very loud explosion, very loud. We quickly jumped out of bed and saw one car on fire. Then the other cars caught on fire as well. The glass shattered on the balconies and windows,â€? said Liudmyla, 58, holding a toddler in her arms. â€œItâ€™s very frightening. Very frightening. The child got scared and jumped out of bed,â€? she said. â€œHow can they do this? How is this possible? They are not humans, I donâ€™t know what to call them. They are frightening the children, their mental state will be disrupted.â€? Moscow says its campaign of targeting Ukraineâ€™s infrastructure far from the front is intended to reduce its ability to fight. Kyiv says the air strikes have no military purpose and aim to harm and intimidate civilians, a war crime. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles, which President Vladimir Putin regularly touts in speeches as a weapon for which NATO has no answer. Ukraine said the missiles had knocked out the power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europeâ€™s largest, severing it from the Ukrainian grid. The plant, which Russia has held since capturing it early in the war, is near the front line and both sides have warned in the past of a potential for disaster there caused by fighting. Moscow said the was being kept safe on diesel backup power. â€œEverything is absolutely normal: the specialists at the plant are working quite professionally, the automation has started up,â€? Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the CEO of Russian state energy firm Rosenergoatom, said on state TV channel Rossiya 24. â€œThere is no threat or danger of a nuclear incident. There is more than enough fuel and, if necessary, it will be supplied to the plant.â€? Alessio Mamo has been at the scene of todayâ€™s strike on Kyiv for the Guardian. Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it had been â€œa difficult nightâ€? as Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Ukraineâ€™s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Kyivâ€™s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. â€œAfter the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capitalâ€™s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,â€? he said on Telegram. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, reported five people had been killed in a strike on the Zolochiv district. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, said two women in their 70s had been injured by a strike on Pisochyn. Ukraineâ€™s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, reported that three people were killed in the southern city of Kherson. Strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. â€œToday, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for ten days,â€? the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. It took two weeks for power to be restored. Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes as without military purpose and â€œjust Russian barbarismâ€?. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia was among the countries that had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine. Russiaâ€™s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldovaâ€™s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistriaâ€™s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multi-billion dollar pipelines last September. He added that it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Ukraine will take part in European Union countriesâ€™ scheme to jointly buy gas, the blocâ€™s energy policy chief said on Thursday. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the countryâ€™s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. In a visit to Kyiv on Wednesday, UN secretary general AntÃ³nio Guterres told journalists it was â€œcriticalâ€? that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. The Kremlin, however, said on Thursday there were still â€œa lot of questionsâ€? remaining over the deal, and that there were currently no plans for a direct meeting with Guterres. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Tobi Thomas will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Another series of air raid sirens have just sounded across Ukraine, including in Odesa and Kherson in the south, Lviv in the west and Sumy in the north. The air raid alert in Kyiv overnight lasted for seven hours, as a total of 81 missiles were fired at targets across the country by Russia. Reuters reports that the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia and other countries had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine. The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Reuters reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multibillion-dollar pipelines last September. He added it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. German prosecutors confirmed yesterday that investigators had searched a boat that may have been used in the bombings. Earlier today our First Edition newsletter carried some analysis of the situation, with Archie Bland speaking to our defence editor, Dan Sabbagh. Here is what they had to say about the range of people who might be considered responsible for the attack: While the consequences for European energy supplies have not ultimately proven severe, there are wider implications, Sabbagh said. â€œTechnically this is an attack in international waters, but itâ€™s within the Nato sphere. Itâ€™s infrastructure well beyond Russia and Ukraine, so it triggered a lot of anxiety about the security of other assets. It makes the war uncomfortably close.â€? If any country with a stake in the region were proven responsible, that would have significant consequences of its own. If the US or a Nato or EU country was behind the attack, that would cause a serious rift in the western alliance in support of Ukraine. If Ukraine did it, fears that Kyiv was acting recklessly would probably diminish their support in Europe and the US â€“ particularly, for obvious reasons, in Germany. And evidence of Moscowâ€™s culpability â€œwould be a new frontier in Russian aggression,â€? Sabbagh said. While a Russian act of sabotage on a Russian-owned piece of infrastructure would not clearly amount to an act of war, the material damage to future gas supplies â€œwould further unite the west against Putinâ€?. You can read more of that analysis here: The mystery of the Nord Stream sabotage â€“ and who may be responsible Ukraine will take part in European Union countriesâ€™ scheme to jointly buy gas, the blocâ€™s energy policy chief said on Thursday. â€œWe have integrated Ukraine in the gas joint purchasing platform with a view to help secure 2bn cubic metres of additional gas,â€? Reuters reports the EU energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, told a meeting of EU lawmakers. EU countries plan to sign their first contracts to jointly buy gas by this summer. The Kremlin said on Thursday that there were still â€œa lot of questionsâ€? remaining over the Black Sea grain deal, and that there were currently no plans for a meeting with the UN secretary general, AntÃ³nio Guterres. The deal, which allows grain to be safely exported from Ukrainian ports despite a Russian naval blockade, expires on 18 March, but cannot be extended if Russia objects. Moscow has already signalled it is unhappy with aspects of the deal, as it seeks to expand the markets for its own agricultural products. Ukraine has said it will seek to extend the deal for at least a year, and wishes the port of Mykolaiv to be included. Kyiv said Russian shelling killed three people on Thursday in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, as Moscow unleashed a wave of missile strikes overnight. â€œRussian terrorists shelled Kherson in the morning. They hit â€¦ a public transport stop. Three people died as a result of the shelling,â€? AFP reports Ukraineâ€™s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on social media. Russiaâ€™s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldovaâ€™s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. In its report Tass writes: Assassination attempts on a number of officials of Transnistria were prepared on the instructions of the Ukrainian security service (SBU), the ministry of state security of the republic reported. Suspects of preparing an assassination attempt on the leader of Transnistria were detained and are giving confessions. The impending assassination attempt on the leader of Transnistria is qualified as a preparation for a terrorist attack. The prosecutor of Transnistria said that the SBU was preparing a terrorist attack using a car bomb in the center of Tiraspol. The claims have not been independently verified. Transnistria, which attempted to break away from Moldova in the early 1990s, borders Ukraineâ€™s west and has Russian troops stationed there. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the countryâ€™s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. â€œI think it is time to make a decision,â€? Reuters reports Nad said on Facebook. â€œPeople are dying in Ukraine, we can really help them, there is no room for Slovak politicking.â€? The governor of Lviv region, Maksym Kozytskyi, has given further details of the strike that has killed five people. In a message on Telegram he posted to say: Today, around 4 oâ€™clock in the morning, an enemy missile fell in the Zolochiv district during an air raid. Three men and two women who were at home at that moment died. The fire destroyed three residential buildings, three cars, a garage and several outbuildings. The fire was extinguished. The demolition of the destroyed buildings has already been completed. 28 rescuers, five units of special equipment and a canine team were involved in the work. Drone footage shows the aftermath of the strike. The regional governor said air defences shot down missiles over Lviv, but â€œI cannot say exactly how many missiles were destroyed over our region, the relevant services have asked not to make this information publicâ€? and he urged the public not to release details. Kozytskyi went on to say: As usual, during the day, internally displaced people arrived in our region by evacuation trains, and people also left by train to PrzemyÅ›l [in Poland]. In the districts of Lviv oblast, humanitarian aid was collected and handed over to soldiers on the frontlines and to residents of frontline settlements, cars were sent to the defenders. Our foreign partners transferred aid to the communities of the region. Everyone lived yesterday, doing good deeds and getting closer to victory in their place. But we woke up to sirens, and news about the dead. We will never forget this day. We will never forgive. And we will direct all our efforts to revenge and the return of justice. Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes on Ukraine as without military purpose and â€œjust Russian barbarismâ€?. In a tweet he said: Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight, leading to loss of lives and damaging civilian infrastructure. No military objective, just Russian barbarism. The day will come when Putin and his associates are held accountable by a special tribunal. Reuters reports that Nato member Denmark has confirmed that Troels Lund Poulsen will continue to act as acting defence minister in the absence of Jakob Ellemann-Jensen. Ellemann-Jensen, 49, was briefly admitted to hospital in February after making a trip to Ukraine and has been on an indefinite period of sick leave. At the time he said in a Facebook message: â€œI have been unusually busy for a long time. Now my body is sending me a signal that itâ€™s time to take a break, if not itâ€™s going to end badly.â€? Here are some more of the images to come out of Kyiv today. Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted to his official Telegram about the nightâ€™s events, writing: Itâ€™s been a difficult night. A massive rocket attack across the country. Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipro, Odesa, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia regions. Attacks on critical infrastructure and residential buildings. Unfortunately, there are injured and dead. My condolences to the families. All services are working. The energy system is being restored. Restrictions were imposed in all regions. The enemy fired 81 missiles in an attempt to intimidate Ukrainians again, returning to their miserable tactics. The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. Thatâ€™s all they can do. But it wonâ€™t help them. They wonâ€™t avoid responsibility for everything they have done. We thank the guardians of our skies and everyone who helps to overcome the consequences of the occupiersâ€™ sneaking attacks. Suspilne, Ukraineâ€™s state broadcaster, has posted this summary to Telegram of the latest news to emerge from the overnight strikes. It reports: In Kyiv, the alarm lasted for about seven hours. Two people were hospitalised due to falling rocket fragments. Five people were killed in the Zolochiv district of the Lviv region due to a rocket hitting a residential area, one person was killed and two were injured in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Energy infrastructure and industrial enterprises were also damaged in the region. About 15 strikes were made in Kharkiv and the region, two people were injured. Critical infrastructure was targeted. Metro and electric transport are not working. In Kirovohrad oblast, Odesa oblast and Zhytomyr oblast, energy infrastructure facilities were hit. Also, according to preliminary information, there are hits in Vinnytsia. At night, electricity restrictions were applied preventively in all regions to reduce risks to the system. Emergency power outages were used in regions where infrastructure was damaged. Kharkiv region and Zhytomyr region are partially de-energized. Kharkiv is completely without electricity. The claims have not been independently verified. Here are some more images from the scene of the strike in Kyiv. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has announced that a fifth person has been killed in overnight strikes. He posted to Telegram to say: The number of people killed as a result of the fall of the rocket in the Zolochiv district has increased to five. The body of another man, born in 1963, was discovered under the rubble. Sincere condolences to the relatives. Ukraineâ€™s air force has issued a statement via Telegram on the wave of attacks from Russia overnight. In it, it claims that â€œthe defence forces of Ukraine destroyed 34 cruise missiles â€¦ as well as 4 â€˜Shahed-136/131â€™ unmanned aerial vehiclesâ€?. It claims that a total of 48 Kalibr-type cruise missiles had been fired by Russia. It described the attack as featuring â€œ81 missiles of various typesâ€? in total, and that â€œthe launches were carried out from 10 Tu-95 strategic aircraft, seven Tu-22M3 long-range aircraft, eight Su-35 fighters, six MiG-31K aircraft and three Kalibr KR carriers in the Black Seaâ€?. It adds: â€œAs a result of organised countermeasures, 8 Kh-31P and Kh-59 guided air missiles did not reach their targets. It is worth noting that the armed forces of Ukraine do not have means capable of destroying Kh-22 and Kh-47 â€˜Kinzhalâ€™ and S-300.â€? The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraineâ€™s state broadcaster, reports that energy company DTEK has reinstated power in Dnipropetrovsk. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has provided this update via Telegram on the situation overnight in his region. He wrote: The enemy launched a massive rocket attack on Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region. At least 15 arrivals of S-300 missiles were recorded. Critical infrastructure objects are hit. In addition, a civil infrastructure object was damaged in the city of Kharkiv. Synyehubov said two women in their 70s were injured in Pisochyn, with one of them hospitalised, and that an agricultural facility was damaged in Slobozhanske. He added that during the previous day, multiple settlements had been shelled with the result that â€œhouses and commercial buildings were damaged, fires broke outâ€?. Here are some of the latest images we have received over the news wires of the aftermath of strikes on Kyiv overnight. Thatâ€™s goodbye from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Iâ€™ll be handing over to my colleague Martin Belam shortly. Here is what happened overnight, as Russia launched mass strikes across a sleeping Ukraine: Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including the capital Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets, including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv, the head of the regional military administration said on Telegram. â€œAt this moment, it is known about four dead. These are four adults. Two men and two women. They were at home when the rocket fell. The debris is still being sorted out. There may be other people under them,â€? said Maksym Kozytskyi. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. â€œAfter the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capitalâ€™s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,â€? he said on Telegram. Strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. â€œToday, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,â€? the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he wonâ€™t meet with Vladimir Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraineâ€™s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet Putin, Zelenskiy said: â€œWe donâ€™t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesnâ€™t hold his wordâ€? and â€œRussia should leave our territory. And after that, weâ€™re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that.â€? Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv, the head of the regional military administration said on Telegram. â€œResidents of Lviv oblast, an air alert lasted for four hours this night â€¦ In Zolochiv district, an enemy rocket fell in a residential area. A fire started. It has already been extinguished,â€? said Maksym Kozytskyi. â€œAt this moment, it is known about four dead. These are four adults. Two men and two women. They were at home when the rocket fell. The debris is still being sorted out. There may be other people under them.â€? Three residential buildings were destroyed. Kozytskyi posted a video of the damage: More now on Zaporizhzhia. The statement from state energy company Energoatom says: On the night of 9 March, the enemy delivered another barbaric massive attack on the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. â€œAs a result of shelling, the last line that fed the ZNPP was damaged. Now the station works on diesel generators. The Russians are putting the world on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe. And this is the day after the negotiations with the UN on the demilitarization of the ZNPP,â€? said Ukraineâ€™s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. Also, as of 6,30am on 9 March, shelling of energy facilities was recorded in the Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, and Zhytomyr regions. Here is our wrap of the attacks overnight: Volleys of Russian missiles struck targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second city of Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, cutting power. Residential areas were also hit, but no casualties were immediately reported. Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Other strikes were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout the country. Kyiv mayor Vitalii Klitschko has just confirmed that one of the explosions was an attack on a power facility, and that 40% of Kyivâ€™s residents are now without heating. It is currently 4C. â€œAfter the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capitalâ€™s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,â€? he said on Telegram. It is currently 8am in Kyiv. Here is a summary of what has happened overnight: Russian strikes hit a series of Ukrainian regions early on Thursday, including the capital Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets, including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions were registered in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. Power supply has been cut pre-emptively to about 15% of Kyiv residents, he said. The strikes cut Ukraineâ€™s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant off from the power grid, the company Energoatom announced on Thursday morning. â€œToday, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,â€? the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraineâ€™s National Grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Zelenskiy said he wonâ€™t meet with Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraineâ€™s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview.

And after that, weâ€™re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after thatâ€?. Here is a photo from Svyatoshyn in Kyiv, where missile strikes set cars alight: Ukraineâ€™s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been off from the Ukrainian power grid, the power company Energoatom announced this morning. â€œToday, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,â€? the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Missile strikes in Zhytomyr have left people in the city without water, according to the mayor. Air sirens are sounding in Mykolaiv, the governor, Vitalii Kim, has just said on Telegram. Electricity supply has been cut for 15% of people in Kyiv, the mayor, Vitalii Klychko, said. Kyiv mayor Vitalii Klychko has confirmed that there has been another explosion in the city, this time in Svyatoshyn district. He said that there were two people injured. â€œAnother explosion in the capital. Svyatoshyn district. All services go to the place. Cars are burning in the yard of one of the residential buildings. The air alert continues. Stay in shelters! Two injured in Sviatoshyn district. Medics provide assistance on the spot.â€? The CEO of Ukrainian power company Yasno, Serhii Kovalenko, has said that emergency power cuts have been put in place due to the mass strikes. â€œMorning. Emergency blackouts are used due to the enemy attack. This is a preventive step, as you all remember,â€? he said. It is currently 7.20 am in Kyiv. The Kyiv Independent reports that, according to one of its journalists, another loud explosion was heard in Kyiv a few minutes ago. â€œThis is nowhere near over,â€? The British Ambassador to Ukraine has just said on Twitter. Maxim Tucker of the Times has posted a video of what he says is smoke rising from Kyiv thermo-electric power station this morning: New Voice of Ukraine journalist Euan MacDonald said that the Kyiv explosion was â€œnear Troyeshyna on left bank of Dnipro (thereâ€™s a heat-power plant nearby). Must have been a big bang if I heard it 10km?â€? Kyivâ€™s mayor has reported that Russia has struck Kyiv during its latest mass strikes accoss Ukraine. â€œExplosions in the Holosiiv district of the capital. All services follow in place. More details later,â€? Kyivâ€™s Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram a few minutes ago. Reporters in Kyiv said they heard a loud explosion at around 6am. The explosions are part of a pre-dawn wave of mass strikes by Russia launched before dawn on Thursday. Maxim Tucker of the Times posted a video of what he said was smoke rising from a thermo-electric power station in Kyiv: Explosions were also reported in Odesa and Ukraineâ€™s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. Air raid sirens sounded across the country. Ukrainian newspaper Dzerkalo Tyzhnia is also reporting an explosion in Kyiv, as well as blasts heard in the city of Sumy, and a drone spotted above the western Lviv region. The Kyiv Post is reporting that one of its journalists has heard explosions in the city amid air raid warnings. The Guardian has not verified this independently. Asked by CNNâ€™s Wolf Blitzer whether the US will send Ukraine F-16 fighter jets Zelensky said, â€œThe fighter jets issue is difficult. Weâ€™re waiting for this decision to be taken.â€? â€œWe really need this and really appeal to the president that they could start training Ukrainian pilots, and President Biden told me that it will be worked upon â€¦ I believe that the United States will give us the opportunity to defend our skies,â€? Zelensky said. Zelenskiy invited top US house speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyivâ€™s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelensky proposed the visit in the interview with CNN. When told of the invitation McCarthy told CNNâ€™s Manu Raju that he does not plan to visit Ukraine, and argued that President Joe Biden has not acted quickly enough to aid the country. McCarthy, a California Republican, has said he supports Ukraine but does not support â€œa blank check,â€? a position he repeated on Tuesday â€“ even though there is federal oversight of all the dollars that are spent there. Zelenskiy said that his children are still in Ukraine. â€œMy daughter joined the university and she studies there, and my son is attending school in Ukraine,â€? he said in his CNN interview. â€œTheyâ€™re both in Ukraine. Theyâ€™re very much like other Ukrainian kids. We live with sirens.â€? â€œWe want victory. We donâ€™t want to get used to war, but we got used to the challenges. Everyone wants one thing: to end the war,â€? he said. Zelenskiy appeared on CNN this evening in the US, in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet with Putin, Zelenskiy said, â€œWe donâ€™t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesnâ€™t hold his wordâ€?. â€œWe donâ€™t have any confidence in him,â€? Zelensky added. â€œRussia should leave our territory. And after that, weâ€™re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after thatâ€?. Here is more detail on what local officials have said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. â€œAs a result of a mass missile strike, an energy infrastructure site was hit in the region as well as residences,â€? Marchenko said on Telegram. He said anti-aircraft units had downed some missiles and new attacks could follow. â€œFortunately, there are no casualties. Electricity restrictions are in effect.â€? Kharkiv region Governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by about 15 strikes. â€œThe enemy made about 15 strikes on the city and region,â€? he said on Telegram. â€œInfrastructure was again among the targets. Information on casualties is being clarified.â€? Another strike was reported in the central city of Dnipro and in the western towns of Lutsk and Rivne, far from the front lines in the year-old war. Air raid sirens are sounding across the country before dawn this morning. BBC Ukraine correspondent Myroslava Petsa wrote on Twitter, â€œItâ€™s 3 am in Ukraine. Russia wonâ€™t let Ukrainians sleep tight tonight. Lots of drones and rockets fired in all possible directions in Ukraine â€¦ This is the terror civiliansâ€™ve been living through for more than a year already.â€? Analysts and Ukrainian leaders had expected mass missile strikes during the week of the anniversary of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine in 24 February. The Kyiv Independent reports that explosions have been heard in several cities and regional communities, but we are waiting for confirmation from local officials. The newspaper listed the cities and regions of Kyiv, Poltava, Lviv, Vinnytsia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Kharkiv, Odesa, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk among those where explosions were heard. Russian strikes hit a series of Ukrainian regions early on Thursday, including the Black Sea port of Odesa and Ukraineâ€™s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, Reuters reported, citing regional officials. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. Residential areas had also been hit, but no casualties were reported. Kharkiv region governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Other strikes were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout the country. Hello and welcome to the Guardianâ€™s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and Iâ€™ll be bringing you the latest. Itâ€™s 5am local time in Kyiv, and we have reports of strikes across Ukraine, including the Black Sea port of Odesa and Ukraineâ€™s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. Weâ€™ll have more news shortly. In the meantime here are the key recent developments in the war: The city of Bakhmut, in Ukraineâ€™s east, could fall in the next few days, said Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. â€œWhat we see is that Russia is throwing more troops, more forces and what Russia lacks in quality they try to make up in quantity. They have suffered big losses, but at the same time, we cannot rule out that Bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming days,â€? he said. The founder of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, which has been leading the Russian assault on Bakhmut, has said Russian forces now fully control the east of the city. The claims have not been independently verified. The General Staff of Ukraineâ€™s armed forces said in its Wednesday morning report: â€œThe enemy, despite significant losses, continues to storm the town of Bakhmut.â€? Russia is unlikely to capture significantly more territory this year, according to the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines. She told a Senate hearing that the military will probably be unable to carry on its current level of fighting, even with the possible capture of Bakhmut. The Pentagon has been accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The defence department is said to be firmly opposed to using the Hague-based ICC, as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has invited top US house speaker Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyivâ€™s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelensky proposed the visit in an interview with CNN. Zelensky has also called for â€œdemocratic successâ€? in Georgia where thousands of protesters have rallied for a second day, against a controversial â€œforeign agentâ€? bill, reminiscent of Russian legislation used to silence critics. â€œThere is no Ukrainian who would not wish success to our friendly Georgia. Democratic success. European success,â€? he said in his evening address to the nation. The US obtained a warrant to seize a Boeing aircraft owned by Russian oil company Rosneft that is valued at over $25m, the Justice Department said. The District Court for the Eastern District of New York authorised the seizure, based on violations of export controls and sanctions against Russia, the Justice Department said. In a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, UN secretary general, AntÃ³nio Guterres, told journalists it was â€œcriticalâ€? that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed, with Ukraine traditionally being one of the worldâ€™s largest exporters of grain. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Wednesday he had suggested the bloc spend â‚¬1bn for the joint procurement of ammunition for Ukraine and to refill their own stockpiles. â€œI propose to mobilise another â‚¬1bn,â€? Reuters reported he told the media after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Stockholm. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg said that it was still uncertain who carried out the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year, and that national investigations needed to be allowed to finish. German officials announced that they searched a ship in January that they believe many have been used to transport explosives used in the sabotage. Germany has the lead role in the investigation. Intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022, the New York Times has reported. There was no evidence President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, or his top lieutenants were involved, or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials, said the report, citing US officials.","charCount":"59960","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tobi-thomas\">Tobi Thomas</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/13/aukus-australian-submarine-nuclear-loophole-proliferation-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T10:22:36Z","webTitle":"Aukus nuclear submarine deal loophole prompts proliferation fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/13/aukus-australian-submarine-nuclear-loophole-proliferation-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/13/aukus-australian-submarine-nuclear-loophole-proliferation-fears","fields":{"headline":"Aukus nuclear submarine deal loophole prompts proliferation fears","standfirst":"<p>Scheme allowing nuclear materials in Australian submarines worries experts about precedent of safeguard removal</p>","trailText":"Scheme allowing nuclear materials in Australian submarines worries experts about precedent of safeguard removal","byline":"Julian Borger in Washington","main":"<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cf36862e-8256-4d02-b3d8-ffd0ddaf4781\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kaw6c6PeqnA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>","body":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/14/australia-news-live-updates-aukus-submarine-nuclear-defence-albanese-agreement-biden-sunak-meeting-pacific-politics-virginia-class-collins\">Aukus scheme</a> announced on Monday in San Diego represents the first time a loophole in the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has been used to transfer fissile material and nuclear technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state.</p> \n<p>The loophole is paragraph 14, and it allows fissile material utilised for non-explosive military use, like naval propulsion, to be exempt from inspections and monitoring by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Here are some things you mightâ€™ve missed:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Putin has agreed for inspectors to visit Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. </strong>According to French President Emmanuel Macronâ€™s office, Putin had â€œreconsidered the demandâ€? that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after the Russian leader himself warned fighting there could bring about a â€œcatastropheâ€?. It specified that Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN secretary-general has asked Russia not take Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant off grid. </strong>AntÃ³nio Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station not be cut off from Ukraineâ€™s electrical grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow is planning to do so, saying the plant used â€œUkrainian electricityâ€?. <br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Western officials say that there are growing concerns over concerns over water cooling at Russian-held nuclear power plant. </strong>The existing reactor cooling system at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is critical to the safety of the site and relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation â€“ but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from the Ukrainian grid.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>More than half of Russia Black Sea naval aviation has been knocked out, according to a western official in Ukraine. </strong>Western officials have said that the Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out â€œmore than halfâ€? of Russiaâ€™s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea. However, overall â€œcombat stasisâ€? remains.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The US has announced a new $775m (Â£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine,</strong> including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. The U.S. has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn (Â£7.6bn) in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russiaâ€™s media watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest.</strong> Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites - including Google, that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of â€œfalse informationâ€? about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined U.S.-based live streaming service Twitch 2 million roubles (Â£28,635) and messenger service Telegram 11 million roubles (Â£158,291) for violating military censorship laws.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>A former Russian mayor has been appointed head of Russian-occupied Kharkiv. </strong>It is the latest in a string of such appointments which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraineâ€™s economy minister has said the countryâ€™s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year. </strong>Hit by Russiaâ€™s Feb. 24 invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p>The Kyiv Independent reported that <strong>rescuers are searching for people and bodies </strong>under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraineâ€™s second-largest city.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesiaâ€™s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. </strong>â€œXi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,â€? he told the news agency. As hosts of this yearâ€™s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.<strong><br></strong></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. </strong>Sitting around 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UKâ€™s ministry of defence reads.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That is all for today.

But they added that there were back-up diesel generators to maintain electricity supply and a Ukrainian workforce at the site â€œable to operate and mitigate against thisâ€?.</p> \n  <p>A loss of electricity supply led to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011.

Here are some things you mightâ€™ve missed: Putin has agreed for inspectors to visit Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to French President Emmanuel Macronâ€™s office, Putin had â€œreconsidered the demandâ€? that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after the Russian leader himself warned fighting there could bring about a â€œcatastropheâ€?. It specified that Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine. The UN secretary-general has asked Russia not take Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant off grid. AntÃ³nio Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station not be cut off from Ukraineâ€™s electrical grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow is planning to do so, saying the plant used â€œUkrainian electricityâ€?. Western officials say that there are growing concerns over concerns over water cooling at Russian-held nuclear power plant. The existing reactor cooling system at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is critical to the safety of the site and relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation â€“ but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from the Ukrainian grid. More than half of Russia Black Sea naval aviation has been knocked out, according to a western official in Ukraine. Western officials have said that the Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out â€œmore than halfâ€? of Russiaâ€™s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea. However, overall â€œcombat stasisâ€? remains. The US has announced a new $775m (Â£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine, including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. The U.S. has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn (Â£7.6bn) in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment. Russiaâ€™s media watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest. Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites - including Google, that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of â€œfalse informationâ€? about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined U.S.-based live streaming service Twitch 2 million roubles (Â£28,635) and messenger service Telegram 11 million roubles (Â£158,291) for violating military censorship laws. A former Russian mayor has been appointed head of Russian-occupied Kharkiv. It is the latest in a string of such appointments which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory. Ukraineâ€™s economy minister has said the countryâ€™s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year. Hit by Russiaâ€™s Feb. 24 invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. The Kyiv Independent reported that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraineâ€™s second-largest city. The Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesiaâ€™s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. â€œXi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,â€? he told the news agency. As hosts of this yearâ€™s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UKâ€™s ministry of defence reads. That is all for today. Thank you for reading along. We will be back bringing you the latest Ukraine news tomorrow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed that a team of independent inspectors can travel to the Moscow-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, the French presidency said on Friday. According to French President Emmanuel Macronâ€™s office, Putin had â€œreconsidered the demandâ€? that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after the Russian leader himself warned fighting there could bring about a â€œcatastropheâ€?. It specified that Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has urged Moscowâ€™s forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia plant in south Ukraine not to disconnect the facility from the grid and potentially cut supplies to millions of Ukrainians. The United States Defence Department on Friday announced a new $775m (Â£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine, including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. â€œWe want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs, and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re doing with this package,â€? a senior US defence official told reporters. The official said Ukraineâ€™s forces have made good use of the now 19 packages of arms the United States has provided since Moscow invaded on February 24. Swiss prosecutors have been asked by an Ukrainian NGO to investigate an alleged attack on a Swiss photojournalist by Russian troops in Ukraine earlier this year, AFP reported on Friday. The NGO Truth Hounds asked Switzerlandâ€™s Office of the Attorney General (OAG) to probe an attack on Swiss freelance journalist Guillaume Briquet in southern Ukraine in March as a possible war crime, according to the Swiss-based Civitas Maxima group that helped it file the complaint. In a statement to AFP, the OAG confirmed that it had received the complaint and said it would â€œnow be examined according to usual procedureâ€?, stressing that a complaint did not automatically mean it would launch an investigation. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Kramatorsk, which is in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. Russia has submitted a letter to the United Nations Security Council warning of planned â€œprovocationsâ€? by Ukraine at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported on Friday, citing a diplomat. The letter repeated Russiaâ€™s previous claim that Kyiv was planning a â€œprovocationâ€? at the plant on Friday, TASS reported. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactor complex, the largest in Europe, was captured by Russia in March but is still run by Ukrainian technicians. The plant has come under repeated shelling, with both Moscow and Kyiv trading blame. The United States is poised to announce it will provide Ukraine with nearly $800m (Â£678m) in new military aid on Friday, including at least a dozen surveillance drones, according to several U.S. officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity with the Associated Press to discuss the aid ahead of its public release. They said the bulk of the aid package will be additional Howitzers (long-range weapons) and ammunition. Two officials confirmed the new inclusion of portable, long-endurance drones which are launched by a catapult and can be retrieved. The U.S. has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn (Â£7.6bn) in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment. France has now released a statement on Macronâ€™s call with Putin. It says the French president â€œonce again underlined his concern at the risks posed by the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plantâ€? and argued for the IAEA experts to attend the plant â€œas soon as possibleâ€?. Putin, the Ã‰lysÃ©e says, supported this idea. The statement continued: The two presidents will talk to each other again in the coming days on this subject, after discussions between the technical teams and before the deployment of the mission. Russian president Vladimir Putin and French counterpart Emmanuel Macron have just finished a phone call about the situation in Ukraine, Moscow has said. In a Kremlin readout of the call, reported by Reuters, Putin said shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, which he blamed on Kyiv, created the risk of â€œlarge-scale catastropheâ€?. Reuters adds: Both presidents agree on the need to send a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency to the plant. According to the Kremlin, Putin told Macron about continuing obstacles to supplying Russian food and fertiliser products to world markets. The UN, Ukraine and western officials have all expressed concerns about Russiaâ€™s maintenance of the nuclear plant. The Kyiv Independent reports that it is the first time Macron and Putin have spoken since May. Russiaâ€™s state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said on Friday that it was taking punitive measures against a string of foreign IT companies, including TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest. In a statement, Roskomnadzor said the measures were in response to the companiesâ€™ failure to remove content that it had flagged as illegal, and would remain in place until they complied. It did not specify what measures would be taken. Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites â€“ including Google, that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of â€œfalse informationâ€? about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined the US-based live streaming service Twitch 2m roubles (Â£28,635) and the messenger service Telegram 11m roubles (Â£158,291) for violating military censorship laws. On 29 July, the media watchdog targeted Novaya Gazeta, one of Russiaâ€™s last remaining independent news outlets, and demanded that its website and print edition be stripped of its licence. Ukraineâ€™s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year, the economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said on Friday. Hit by Russiaâ€™s Feb. 24 invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. Western officials said on Friday they were concerned whether water cooling can be maintained at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently held by the Russians, amid accusations that the invaders are not properly maintaining the site. The existing reactor cooling system, critical to the safety of the site, relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation â€“ but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from the Ukrainian grid. One Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said â€œthe issue we are concerned about is water cooling of the nuclear reactorsâ€? and that it was â€œa situation we should all be watching very closelyâ€?. But they added that there were back-up diesel generators to maintain electricity supply and a Ukrainian workforce at the site â€œable to operate and mitigate against thisâ€?. A loss of electricity supply led to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Main power was lost after an earthquake and a tsunami overwhelmed the back-up generators on site. The loss of cooling was enough to lead to a partial reactor meltdown. The western official said that fighting around the plant was considered a far lesser risk because nuclear reactors are designed to withstand relatively heavy impacts with thick walling. â€œThey are built to be able to cope with a civilian airline crashing into them,â€? the official said, and added that â€œdirect firesâ€? such as artillery was â€œnot our immediate concernâ€?. But they would not comment on whether they believed Russia was deliberately staging forces at the site, or was preparing a false flag operation, other than to note that â€œboth sides are contesting the information environmentâ€?. Social media videos appeare to show Russian forces basing themselves on the site. Olexander, a former worker at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station wrote an account of living in Enerhodar, a satellite city for the plant, for the Guardian. I dedicated my life to nuclear power and have always been proud to be part of it. For many people like me, the Zaporizhzhia plant is our pride and destiny. There are six powerful units, about half of the capacity of all Ukrainian nuclear plants and a quarter of the countryâ€™s entire energy sector. Before the war, 11,000 people worked here. More than 50,000 people live in Enerhodar. We have been living under occupation for almost six months. Itâ€™s like a double occupation â€“ the city and the nuclear plant have been captured. Our faith is constantly being tested. Ten days ago, we were sure that the city and the inhabitants would not suffer. But they are already wounded from the shelling at the station. There are already victims in the city. Read the rest of the piece here: The Guardianâ€™s Dan Sabbagh reported on Friday that â€œsignificant effortsâ€? are being made â€œto understand if Ukraine can mount a successful counter attack in the southâ€?. Tweeting from a â€œwestern officialsâ€? briefing, Sabbagh added that â€œsuch attacks are not without riskâ€?. The UN secretary general has asked Russia not to cut the nuclear plant from Ukraineâ€™s grid. AntÃ³nio Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station not be cut off from Ukraineâ€™s grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow is planning to do so. â€œObviously the electricity from Zaporizhzhia is Ukrainian electricity â€¦ This principle must be fully respected,â€? said the UN secretary general during a visit to the port of Odesa in southern Ukraine. The Guardianâ€™s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, tweeting live from a briefing on Friday, said the Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out â€œmore than halfâ€? of Russiaâ€™s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea. However, overall â€œcombat stasisâ€? remains. He added, from the briefing, that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant â€œshould be able to withstand most direct military fire. Built strong enough to resist impact of a civilian airliner. Concerns focused around whether the plant suffers a loss of cooling due to the loss of back-up electricity.â€? Concerns around shelling near the plant, the largest in Europe, have been growing since it was taken over by Russian forces in March. It is still being run by Ukrainians. The UN secretary general, AntÃ³nio Guterres, has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment from the site. A former mayor of a Russian city has been appointed to head a Russian-installed government in north-east Ukraine, the latest in a string of such appointments which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory. Andrei Alekseyenko resigned as mayor of Krasnodar on Thursday. He will now head a new Russian-appointed council of ministers in the Kharkiv province, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported on Friday, citing a decree by the local Russian-installed administration. Russian officials have previously said that occupied areas of Ukraine will never return to Kyivâ€™s control, and that referendums on their accession to Russia may be held in the autumn. Ukraine has called them â€œpseudo-referendumsâ€? and vowed to prevent them. Italian newspapers have issued front-page warnings of alleged Russian interference in the upcoming election on Friday. This comes as a response to comments from Russiaâ€™s former president urging Europeans to â€œpunishâ€? their â€œstupidâ€? governments, AFP reports. The former president and current deputy chair of Russiaâ€™s security council, Dmitry Medvedev, on Thursday called for Europeans to be â€œnot only outraged at the actions of their governments ... but to hold them to account and punish them for their obvious stupidityâ€?. â€œAct, European neighbours! Donâ€™t remain silent! Demand accountability!â€? he said on Telegram. Following Medvedevâ€™s comments, la Repubblica and il Messaggero front pages on Friday wrote of Russian â€œinterferenceâ€?, while the Corriere della Sera said Russia was â€œagitatingâ€? political waters ahead of the vote due to be held on 25 September. Rishi Sunak has called on the G20 to bar the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, from its summit until Moscow halts the war in Ukraine, his spokesperson told Reuters on Friday. Putin and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, are said to be attending G20, which will be held on the island of Bali in November, according to earlier reports from Indonesiaâ€™s president, Joko Widodo. â€œOur G20 partners and allies have a collective responsibility to call Putinâ€™s abhorrent behaviour out. Sitting round a table with him isnâ€™t good enough when he is responsible for children being killed in their beds as they sleep,â€? a spokesperson for the former chancellor told Reuters. They added: â€œWe need to send a strong message to Putin that he doesnâ€™t have a seat at the table unless and until he stops his illegal war in Ukraine.â€? Sunak is currently trailing behind the foreign secretary, Liz Truss , in polls in the contest to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. In a televised debate on 25 July, Truss said it would be important to confront Putin in front of Russiaâ€™s allies. She said:, â€œI would go there, and I would call Putin out.â€? As hosts of this yearâ€™s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Itâ€™s 11am in the UK and 1pm in Ukraine. Here is everything thatâ€™s happened so far today: The Kyiv Independent reports that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraineâ€™s second-largest city. Natoâ€™s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will participate online in the second summit of the Crimea Platform, an international platform for work and cooperation on the liberation of Crimea. Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Ukrainians to stay away from enemy command posts and logistics bases, after reports of explosions overnight in Russian-occupied Crimea. According to Ukraineâ€™s General Staff, Russia has lost 44,700 troops in Ukraine, the Kyiv Independent reports. There were â€œno claimed or assessed Russian territorial gains in Ukraine on August 18, 2022 for the first time since July 6, 2022â€?, a report by the Institute for the Study of War, has found. Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine, the head of Britainâ€™s GCHQ intelligence service has said. â€œPresident Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west,â€? Jeremy Fleming said in an op-ed in the Economist on Friday. â€œJust as with its land invasion, Russiaâ€™s initial online plans appear to have fallen short.â€? Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Russian forces may be preparing to stage a â€œprovocationâ€? at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraineâ€™s military intelligence has warned. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. The Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesiaâ€™s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. â€œXi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,â€? Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency. The Kyiv Independent reports that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraineâ€™s second-largest city. The head of Kharkiv Oblast police, Volodymyr Tymoshko, said there are currently 19 people confirmed dead, including a child, and 20 injured, with the death toll expected to rise after Russian rockets struck two hostel dormitories. Natoâ€™s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will participate online in the second summit of the Crimea Platform, an international platform for work and cooperation on the liberation of Crimea. The summit, initiated by Ukraine, will be available to watch live on Natoâ€™s website. Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Ukrainians to stay away from enemy command posts and logistics bases. â€œDo not approach the military objects of the Russian army,â€? he said after reports of explosions overnight in Russian-occupied Crimea. Speaking on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Russians have realised that Crimea is â€œnot a place for themâ€? and hinted more attacks could lie ahead. Fires and explosions have been reported at military targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, in the latest of a string of apparent sabotage missions deep into Russian-held territory. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a blaze at a munitions depot near the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province. â€œAn ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovoâ€?, less than 50km from the border, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said in a statement, adding that no casualties were reported. According to the Kyiv Independent, Oleg Kryuchkov, an advisor to the head of the Russian occupation government in Ukraineâ€™s Crimea, posted on the social media app Telegram that the Russian military had destroyed a target in the city of Kerch, which is linked to Russiaâ€™s Krasnodar Krai via the strategic Crimean Bridge. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the Presidentâ€™s Office, said on 17 August that the Crimean Bridge should be destroyed. The Kyiv Independent reports that according to Ukraineâ€™s General Staff, Russia has lost 44,700 troops in Ukraine as well as 1,899 tanks, 4,195 armoured fighting vehicles, 1,016 artillery systems, 266 multiple launch rocket systems, 141 air defence systems, 197 helicopters, 234 airplanes, 795 drones, and 15 boats. A new report from the The Institute for the Study of War, a non-profit research organisation in the US has found there were â€œno claimed or assessed Russian territorial gains in Ukraine on August 18, 2022 for the first time since July 6, 2022â€?. The report suggests Russian propaganda has been intensified as tensions continue to build around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as the chief of Russiaâ€™s radiation, chemical and biological defence forces, Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, claimed on 18 August in a briefing that â€œUkrainian forces are preparing for a provocation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and that the provocation is meant to coincide with UN secretary general Antonio Guterresâ€™s visit to Ukraineâ€?. It is 9am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine, the head of Britainâ€™s GCHQ intelligence service has said. â€œPresident Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west,â€? Jeremy Fleming said in an op-ed in The Economist on Friday. â€œJust as with its land invasion, Russiaâ€™s initial online plans appear to have fallen short.â€? Multiple unconfirmed reports are claiming Ukraineâ€™s second-largest city of Kharkiv has been struck again this morning. The Kyiv Independent cited Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov, as saying Russian forces fired on three of the cityâ€™s districts at around 5.44am. Terekhov said a residential building was damaged and another building caught fire. If confirmed, the attack would be the third to hit city in three days. Kharkiv regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least 17 people were killed and 42 injured in two separate recent Russian attacks on the city. Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UKâ€™s ministry of defence reads. Russian forces may be preparing to stage a â€œprovocationâ€? at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraineâ€™s military intelligence has warned. Ukraineâ€™s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russiaâ€™s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. The UN secretary general has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces from the site. AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was â€œgravely concernedâ€? about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: â€œWe must tell it like it is â€“ any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.â€? Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the power plant. â€œWe are worried. We donâ€™t want another Chornobyl,â€? the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, added. Four explosions hit an area near a major Russian military airport in Crimea on Thursday, local sources reported, but a pro-Moscow official said no damage had been done. The governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said Russian anti-aircraft forces had downed a Ukrainian drone. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a fire broke out at an ammunition depot near the border with Ukraine on Thursday, local authorities said. An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo, less than 50km (30 miles) from the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. President Joe Biden would authorise the assistance using his presidential drawdown authority, which allows the president to authorise the transfer of excess weapons from US stocks. Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. â€œXi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,â€? Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency. Ukraineâ€™s second-largest city of Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting about 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UKâ€™s ministry of defence reads. Multiple rocket launchers and generally inaccurate area weapons have caused devastation across large parts of the city. Russian forces continue to conduct local raids and probing attacks against Ukrainian forces, the ministry added. They are probably trying to force Ukraine to maintain significant forces on this front, to prevent them from being employed as a counter-attack force elsewhere.â€? Studying in Kryvyi Rih in the 1990s, Ukraineâ€™s wartime leader often skipped class to focus on his standup, our correspondent Luke Harding reports from Zelenskiyâ€™s hometown. â€œVolodymyr Zelenskiy was special. He was bright, hard-working and wanted to be the best of the best,â€? Andrii Shaikan, rector of the state university in Zelenskiyâ€™s home town of Kryvyi Rih, said. Read the full story below. Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News on Thursday. â€œXi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,â€? Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency. Indonesia is chairing the Group of 20 major economies and has faced pressure from Western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin over his countryâ€™s invasion on Ukraine, which his government calls a â€œspecial military operationâ€?. Jokowi has sought to position himself as mediator between the warring countries, and has travelled to meet both Ukraineâ€™s and Russiaâ€™s presidents. This week, Jokowi said both countries have accepted Indonesia as a â€œbridge of peaceâ€?. Leaders of major countries, including US president Joe Biden, are set to meet in Indonesiaâ€™s resort island of Bali in November. Indonesia has also invited Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Guardian correspondent Luke Harding came upon a mural of outgoing UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, while reporting in the southern Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, the home town of the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The design â€“ created by a collective from Odesa â€“ shows a mop-haired Johnson giving a thumbs up. The muralâ€™s artist, Anastasia Scherba, said she was grateful to Johnson for supporting Ukraine and giving it weapons. â€œHeâ€™s cool,â€? she said Multiple unconfirmed reports are claiming Ukraineâ€™s second-largest city of Kharkiv has been struck again this morning. The Kyiv Independent newspaper cited Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov, as saying Russian forces fired on three of the cityâ€™s districts at around 5.44am. Terekhov reported that Kharkivâ€™s Kyivskyi, Osnovyanskyi, and Nemyshlianskyi districts were affected. A residential building was damaged and another unspecified building caught fire as a result of the shelling. One person has been reported injured so far. If confirmed, the attack would be the third to have hit city in three days. Kharkiv regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least 17 people were killed and 42 injured in two separate recent Russian attacks on the city. Three civilians were killed and 17 wounded in a pre-dawn rocket strike on Thursday, after an attack from Russia the day before. â€œAs of now, 17 people have died in Kharkiv â€¦ and 42 people have been injured,â€? Synehubov said, describing the attacks as â€œan act of terrorismâ€?. Fires and explosions have been reported at military targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, in the latest of a string of apparent sabotage missions deep into Russian-held territory. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a blaze at a munitions depot near the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province. â€œAn ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovoâ€?, less than 50km from the border, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement, adding that no casualties were reported. At least four explosions hit near the major Belbek airbase, north of Sevastopol in the occupied Crimean peninsula. The pro-Russia governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said: â€œThere is no damage. No one was hurt.â€? Air defences were also activated near Kerch, the city at the Crimean end of a bridge to mainland Russia, which is a strategically vital supply route that many in Ukraine would like to see destroyed. Local media said a Ukrainian drone was shot down. Amid fears that Russian forces may be preparing to stage a â€œprovocationâ€? at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, world leaders have called to urgently secure the site. The UN secretary general called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment. AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was â€œgravely concernedâ€? about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: We must tell it like it is â€“ any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.â€? â€œThe facility must not be used as part of any military operation. Instead, agreement is urgently needed to re-establish Zaporizhzhiaâ€™s purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area,â€? Guterres said. Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the power plant. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, added: We are worried. We donâ€™t want another Chornobyl.â€? Ukraineâ€™s military intelligence has warned that Russian forces may be preparing to stage a â€œprovocationâ€? at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant they control. Ukraineâ€™s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russiaâ€™s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. Russian state media had already accused Ukraine of planning a â€œprovocationâ€? at the plant to coincide with the UN secretary generalâ€™s visit to Ukraine, raising fears that Russiaâ€™s military could be planning a â€œfalse-flag attackâ€?. When AntÃ³nio Guterres travelled to Kyiv in April, Moscow carried out an airstrike on the city. On Wednesday, Ukraineâ€™s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, said Ukraine must â€œprepare for all scenariosâ€?, during a drill for emergency workers in Zaporizhzhia. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, also warned Russiaâ€™s seizure of the plant had â€œraised the risk of a nuclear accident or incidentâ€? and accused Moscow of being â€œrecklessâ€? by using the area as a staging platform to launch artillery attacks on Ukrainian forces. Russia said it may shut down the plant, claiming backup support systems had been damaged in strikes. Igor Kirillov, the head of the radioactive, chemical and biological defence force, said if there was an accident at the site, radioactive material would cover Poland, Germany and Slovenia. Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine almost six months after its invasion of the country, the head of Britainâ€™s GCHQ intelligence service has said. Jeremy Fleming, the intelligence head, said both countries have been using their cyber capabilities in the war in Ukraine. In an op-ed in The Economist on Friday, he wrote: So far, president Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west. Although thatâ€™s cause for celebration, we should not underestimate how Russian disinformation is playing out elsewhere in the world. Just as with its land invasion, Russiaâ€™s initial online plans appear to have fallen short. The countryâ€™s use of offensive cyber tools has been irresponsible and indiscriminate.â€? Fleming said Russia had deployed WhisperGate malware to destroy and deface Ukrainian government systems. He also said Russia has used the same playbook before on Syria and the Balkans and said online disinformation is a major part of Russiaâ€™s strategy. However, the GCHQ has been able to intercept and to provide warnings in time, he said. Without going into much detail, Fleming said the UKâ€™s National Cyber Force could respond to Russia by deploying a UK military unit that employs offensive cyber tools. Hello and welcome back to the Guardianâ€™s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Iâ€™m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether youâ€™ve been following our coverage overnight or youâ€™ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine almost six months after its invasion of the country, the head of Britainâ€™s GCHQ intelligence service has said. The UN secretary general has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces from Ukraineâ€™s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was â€œgravely concernedâ€? about the situation at the site and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: â€œWe must tell it like it is â€“ any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.â€? It is 7am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Russian forces may be preparing to stage a â€œprovocationâ€? at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraineâ€™s military intelligence has warned. Ukraineâ€™s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russiaâ€™s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. The UN secretary general has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces from the site. AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was â€œgravely concernedâ€? about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: â€œWe must tell it like it is â€“ any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.â€? Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the power plant. â€œWe are worried. We donâ€™t want another Chornobyl,â€? the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, added. At least 17 people were killed and 42 injured in two separate Russian attacks on Kharkiv, according to its regional governor. Three civilians were killed and 17 wounded in a pre-dawn rocket strike on Thursday, after an attack from Russia the day before. â€œAs of now, 17 people have died in Kharkiv â€¦ and 42 people have been injured,â€? Oleh Synehubov said, describing the attacks as â€œan act of terrorismâ€?. Four explosions hit an area near a major Russian military airport in Crimea on Thursday, local sources reported, but a pro-Moscow official said no damage had been done. The governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said Russian anti-aircraft forces had downed a Ukrainian drone. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a fire broke out at an ammunition depot near the border with Ukraine on Thursday, local authorities said. An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo, less than 50km (30 miles) from the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. President Joe Biden would authorise the assistance using his presidential drawdown authority, which allows the president to authorise the transfer of excess weapons from US stocks. The Russian military announced that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the countryâ€™s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the west arming Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy took over a major news conference after becoming irked by a interpreterâ€™s failure to translate his comments properly into English. Zelenskiy acted after the interpreter cut short his remarks during an event with Turkish president Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan and United Nations secretary general AntÃ³nio Guterres. Zelenskiy confirmed that Ukraine has not changed its position on peace negotiations, saying talks with Russia are only possible if Russian forces leave illegally occupied territory in Ukraine. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russians, its government said. Estoniaâ€™s foreign minister also defended his countryâ€™s decision to bar Russian tourists.","charCount":"38446","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/sarah-haque\">Sarah Haque</a>, <a href=\"profile/gemma-mcsherry\">Gemma McSherry</a> and <a href=\"profile/samantha-lock\">Samantha Lock</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/27/vietnam-war-documentary-nixon-nuclear-weapons-pbs","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-28T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Did Vietnam peace protests stop Nixon using nuclear weapons?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/vietnam-war-documentary-nixon-nuclear-weapons-pbs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/27/vietnam-war-documentary-nixon-nuclear-weapons-pbs","fields":{"headline":"Did Vietnam peace protests stop Nixon using nuclear weapons?","standfirst":"<p>A new documentary, released amid Putinâ€™s brinksmanship over Ukraine, argues that marches in 1969 changed the US presidentâ€™s mind.

EDF, which runs Britainâ€™s nuclear power stations, said the profit was related to stronger operational performance of its nuclear fleet, and higher energy prices. The company is building Britainâ€™s newest nuclear reactor, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, which has been hit by delays and climbing costs. The cost of the project was originally set at Â£18bn, before it was later put at Â£25bn to Â£26bn. On Friday, EDF said that Â£25bn to Â£26bn remained the estimated cost based on 2015 calculations but â€œthe estimated nominal cost at completion could reach Â£32.7bnâ€? because of inflation. The company, which is mostly state-owned but is being fully nationalised in France, is the UKâ€™s fourth-largest energy supplier, providing gas and electricity to more than 5m UK households. EDF said Britainâ€™s cap on energy bills hit earnings at its energy supply business, which made a loss of Â£200m. The company said this was because it cost it more to buy energy to supply to its residential customers than the price it was allowed to charge them under the energy price cap. The UK profit was a rare bright spot for EDF in its annual results, which reported a record net loss of â‚¬17.9bn (Â£16bn) for the whole group in 2022, as its nuclear output plunged to a 34-year low after a record number of outages at its reactors in France. Stress corrosion cracks were found in pipes in the cooling systems of some reactors. The groupâ€™s net debt rose to almost â‚¬65bn last year, up from â‚¬43bn a year earlier. EDFâ€™s chief executive, Luc RÃ©mont, who was appointed by the French government last November to turn the company around, said: â€œToday, our priority is to put EDF back on track.â€? EDF said it invested Â£2.6bn in the UK in 2022 in its nuclear, renewables and customer businesses. The company said it was investing more than Â£13bn in the UK between 2023 and 2025, largely in the Hinkley Point scheme. It is also planning to invest about Â£2bn in its existing nuclear fleet and renewables projects this year. It welcomed the UK governmentâ€™s decision last November confirming that the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk would go ahead, and which will be developed by EDF. The government has taken a 50% stake in the project, which will be the second of a new generation of UK nuclear power reactors, after Hinkley Point C.","charCount":"2661","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/joanna-partridge\">Joanna Partridge</a>","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/22/we-need-more-honesty-on-nuclear-powers-long-legacy-of-hazardous-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T17:15:30Z","webTitle":"We need more honesty on nuclear powerâ€™s long legacy of hazardous waste | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/22/we-need-more-honesty-on-nuclear-powers-long-legacy-of-hazardous-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/22/we-need-more-honesty-on-nuclear-powers-long-legacy-of-hazardous-waste","fields":{"headline":"We need more honesty on nuclear powerâ€™s long legacy of hazardous waste","standfirst":"<p><strong>Tom Smith, William Walker </strong>and <strong>Neil Smith </strong>respond to Samanth Subramanianâ€™s long read on the enormous task of dismantling Sellafield </p>","trailText":"Letters: <strong>Tom Smith, William Walker </strong>and <strong>Neil Smith </strong>respond to Samanth Subramanianâ€™s long read on the enormous task of dismantling Sellafield ","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b553bd63dbcd92db0c347f234c5add769adaee0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b553bd63dbcd92db0c347f234c5add769adaee0/258_278_5119_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial photograph of the Sellafield nuclear fuel processing site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sellafield nuclear fuel processing site. â€˜Nuclear power generates large quantities of hazardous human-made waste,â€™ says Tom Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Goddard/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Samanth Subramanian captures perfectly the vast scale and longevity of the effort needed to clean up Sellafield (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site\">The long read, 15 December</a>).

Hereâ€™s where we stand: The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has described the situation at Ukraineâ€™s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine as â€œvery dangerousâ€? and very unstable. He said his attempt to broker a deal to protect the plant was still alive, adding that there had been increasing military activity in the region without giving details. Ukraineâ€™s frontline city of Avdiivka â€œis being wiped off the face of the Earthâ€? amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a â€œsecond Bakhmutâ€?. Starting on Sunday, the cityâ€™s utilities will begin to be shut off as â€œmore and more of the town is shelled and destroyed daily,â€? said Vitaliy Barabash, the cityâ€™s military administration head. Russiaâ€™s 10th tank regiment has borne the brunt of the assault of Avdiivka and has likely lost a â€œlarge portion of its tanksâ€? while attempting to surround the town from the south, the UKâ€™s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. It said the regiment belonged to the 3rd Army Corps, the first major new formation Russia stood up to support its invasion since August 2022 and despite a period of training in Belarus, the formation â€œappears to display limited combat effectivenessâ€?. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces has said. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Ukraineâ€™s northern Sumy region during his tour of areas of the country that have borne the brunt of Russiaâ€™s invasion. Zelenskiy met officials and local residents in the city of Okhtyrka, which had fierce battles last year but was never occupied, and Trostianets, which was occupied by Russian forces for a month and liberated in March 2022. During the past seven days, the Ukrainian leader has visited the Kherson and Kharkiv regions, parts of which were retaken last year from Russia, to the frontline area near Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region, and to Zaporizhzhia in the south. Germanyâ€™s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. Berlin had promised 14 vehicles but increased that to 18 as part of a deal under which several EU states would contribute to a shipment of two Leopard 2 battalions and 31 American-made M1A2 Abrams tanks from the US. The first Brotosj Challenger 2 main battle tanks have arrived in Ukraine and will soon begin combat missions, the countryâ€™s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has said. The UK said in January it would send 14 of the tanks to Ukraine. Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the tanks had â€œrecently arrived in our countryâ€? and posted a video that showed him sitting in one of a long line of tanks in an open field, all of them flying Ukraineâ€™s yellow and blue flag. The US supports the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute the crime of â€œaggressionâ€? against Ukraine, officials said. The US ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, Beth Van Schaak said the court might also be located elsewhere in Europe, at least at first, â€œin order â€œto reinforce Ukraineâ€™s desired European orientationâ€?. Belarusâ€™s foreign ministry has justified its decision to allow Russia to station nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, saying Minsk was acting to protect itself after years of pressure from the US and its allies aimed at changing its political and geopolitical direction. Minsk had been forced to house Russian nuclear weapons on its territory by the aggressive actions of Nato countries that were threatening Belarusâ€™s own security, it said, according to Russian news agency Tass. Belarus will certainly face further EU sanctions resulting from Vladimir Putinâ€™s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, Polandâ€™s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Poland was considering further limitations on cross-border traffic, Morawiecki added. A Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine has been sentenced to two years in a penal colony, according to a rights group. Alexei Moskalyov, a single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, has been separated from his daughter, Maria, since he was placed under house arrest and she was taken into a state-run shelter last month. Court officials said on Tuesday that the 54-year-old fled house arrest overnight and that his whereabouts were unknown. The International Olympic Committee has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in international sporting events under a neutral flag. A decision regarding next yearâ€™s Olympics in Paris and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in 2026 would be taken â€œat the appropriate timeâ€?, it said. Germanyâ€™s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said the committeeâ€™s decision is â€œa slap in the face for all Ukrainian athletesâ€?. Thatâ€™s it from me, LÃ©onie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Weâ€™ll be back tomorrow. Thank you. The US has not seen any indications that Russia is getting closer to using tactical nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby has said. It comes after Vladimir Putin announced on Saturday that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The Russian president said he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, who he said had â€œlong raised the questionâ€? of a nuclear deployment on his countryâ€™s territory. Speaking to reporters today, Kirby said: Weâ€™re watching this as best we can. We havenâ€™t seen any movement by Mr Putin to act on what he pledged he would do. The Belarusian foreign ministry today confirmed it will host Russian tactical nuclear weapons, saying the decision was a response to years of western pressure. Donetsk regional police have published footage showing scenes of devastation in Ukraineâ€™s frontline city of Avdiivka. The video shows destroyed residential blocks with charred walls and piles of rubble on deserted streets as police continue to evacuate civilians. Starting on Sunday, the city will begin to shut off its utilities as â€œmore and more of the town is shelled and destroyed daily,â€? said Vitaliy Barabash, its military administration head. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a â€œsecond Bakhmutâ€?. The US supports the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute the crime of â€œaggressionâ€? against Ukraine, officials said. A US state department spokesperson said: We believe that this Special Tribunal should be rooted in Ukraineâ€™s domestic judicial system, as this will provide the clearest path to establishing a new Tribunal and maximize our chances of achieving meaningful accountability. The US ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, Beth Van Schaak also announced Washingtonâ€™s support for such a court in a speech on Monday night. She said: At this critical moment in history, I am pleased to announce that the United States supports the development of an internationalised tribunal dedicated to prosecuting the crime of aggression against Ukraine. She said the court might also be located elsewhere in Europe, at least at first, \"in order â€œto reinforce Ukraineâ€™s desired European orientationâ€?. Ukraine, the EU and the Netherlands have publicly backed the idea of a special tribunal. Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a â€œspecial military operation,â€? has denied accusations of war crimes including deliberate targeting of Ukrainian civilians. Hereâ€™s some reaction to the IOCâ€™s recommendation that Russian and Belarusian athletes be allowed to compete under a neutral flag in international sporting events. Germanyâ€™s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said the committeeâ€™s decision is â€œa slap in the face for all Ukrainian athletesâ€?, posting to Twitter: I would have liked the Russian and Belarusian athletes to remain excluded. There is no reason whatsoever for Russia to return to world sport. Wladimir Klitschko, the Ukrainian former professional boxer, accused IOC president Thomas Bach of serving â€œthe colours and interests of Russiaâ€?. Polandâ€™s deputy foreign minister, Piotr Wawrzyk, said it was â€œa day of shame for the IOCâ€?, posting to Twitter: What positive things has Russia done for their athletes to now take part in competitions!! After Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel!! After the daily bombings of civilian sites!! A 200-year-old bronze statue commemorating Nelsonâ€™s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar is to be surrounded by thousands of sandbags to echo the plight of monuments in Ukraine. The plan for Liverpoolâ€™s Nelsonâ€™s Monument is one of 24 cultural commissions announced on Tuesday as part of a festival that aims to transform the city in the run-up to its staging of the Eurovision song contest. Running from 1-14 May, it will, say the organisers, be â€œthe pre-party to end all pre-partiesâ€? as fans from across the world descend on the city. Claire McColgan, the director of Culture Liverpool, said the planned EuroFestival would be a â€œscouse/Ukrainian mashup of brillianceâ€?. She added: No other Eurovision host city has ever curated a creative programme of such scale and scope. This is the spirit of Eurovision spilling on to our streets. Free for all. Accessible to all. Uniting us all. Read the full story here: The International Olympic Committee has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in international sporting events under a neutral flag. The IOC issued a set of recommendations, which stated that those â€œwith a Russian or a Belarusian passport must compete only as Individual Neutral Athletesâ€?, meaning individuals can compete without national symbols, such as a flag. A decision regarding next yearâ€™s Olympics in Paris and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in 2026 would be taken â€œat the appropriate timeâ€?, it said. It added that â€œathletes who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agenciesâ€? could also not be considered. IOC president Thomas Bach, speaking at a news conference today, said: What is maybe most important, what has changed, is that participation of athletes with Russian and Belarusian passports in competitions and in international competitions, works. The US will not provide Russia with data on its nuclear forces, the White House has said, following Vladimir Putinâ€™s decision to suspend Moscowâ€™s participation in the New Start nuclear arms treaty. The 2010 agreement, which limited the number of strategic nuclear warheads each side can deploy, was the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the US and Russia. Putin announced its suspension in February, accusing Washington of trying to inflict a â€œstrategic defeatâ€? on Moscow in Ukraine. A spokesperson for the US national security council said today: Under international law, the United States has the right to respond to Russiaâ€™s breaches of the New Start Treaty by taking proportionate and reversable countermeasures in order to induce Russia to return to compliance with its obligations. They added: That means that because Russiaâ€™s claimed suspension of the New Start Treaty is legally invalid, the US is legally permitted to withhold our biannual data update in response to Russiaâ€™s breaches. The US has previously said Moscowâ€™s decision to suspend its participation in the treaty showed it was not a responsible nuclear partner. Russia and the US together hold 90% of the worldâ€™s nuclear warheads. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has described the situation at Ukraineâ€™s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine as â€œvery dangerousâ€? and very unstable. The nuclear facility has lost its external power supply six times since Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago, forcing emergency diesel generators to kick in to cool its reactors. Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the water level in a nearby reservoir controlled by Russian forces was another potential danger. Water supplied by the reservoir is used to cool the reactors. He told Reuters: If the reservoir level goes down beyond a certain level, then you donâ€™t have water to cool down the reactors, and we have seen especially in January that the levels of the water were going down significantly. They recovered somehow in the past few weeks. He added that there had been increasing military activity in the region without giving details. Grossi, who yesterday met with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the Dnipro hydroelectric power station, northeast of the Zaporizhzhia plant, said his attempt to broker a deal to protect the plant was still alive, and that he was adjusting the proposals to seek a breakthrough. He was speaking a day before he is expected to travel to the nuclear plant, the largest in Europe. Grossi has been pushing for a safety zone to be created at the plant to prevent a possible nuclear disaster as Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the site of the power station. Kyiv does not want a deal that will in effect recognise or allow a Russian military presence at the plant. Grossi added: I am confident that it might be possible to establish some form of protection, perhaps not emphasising so much the idea of a zone, but on the protection itself: what people should do, or shouldnâ€™t do to protect (the plant) instead of having a territorial concept. Itâ€™s 6pm in Kyiv. Hereâ€™s where we stand: Ukraineâ€™s frontline city of Avdiivka â€œis being wiped off the face of the Earthâ€? amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a â€œsecond Bakhmutâ€?.

It said the regiment belonged to the 3rd Army Corps, the first major new formation Russia stood up to support its invasion since August 2022 and despite a period of training in Belarus, the formation â€œappears to display limited combat effectivenessâ€?. Higher quality Wagner units have likely been committed to fighting around Avdiivka â€œpotentially to reinforce recent limited tactical successes in the areaâ€?, according to the Institute for Study of War (ISW). The ISW said the deployments appear intended to help support weaker units from the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic and that if confirmed, their involvement may help â€œexplain the limited tactical gains made in the area over the past weekâ€?. Russian forces launched 24 airstrikes, 12 missile strikes and carried out 55 attacks from rocket salvo systems in the last 24 hours, according the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. A missile strike in the city of Sloviansk damaged high-rise buildings and private houses, causing deaths and injuries among civilians. A separate airstrike in the city of Bersyslav also caused damaged to civilian infrastructure. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Ukraineâ€™s northern Sumy region during his tour of areas of the country that have borne the brunt of Russiaâ€™s invasion. Zelenskiy met officials and local residents in the city of Okhtyrka, which had fierce battles last year but was never occupied, and Trostianets, which was occupied by Russian forces for a month and liberated in March 2022.

Court officials said on Tuesday that the 54-year-old fled house arrest overnight and that his whereabouts were unknown. Good afternoon from London. Itâ€™s LÃ©onie Chao-Fong here with all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Earlier we reported that a Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine had reportedly been sentenced to two years in prison. It appears that the whereabouts of the convicted man, Alexei Moskalyov, is unclear. Court officials have said the 54-year-old fled house arrest overnight, and was not present for the outcome of his trial. He had been wearing a bracelet that tracked his movements but apparently had taken it off. Moskalyovâ€™s lawyer, Vladimir Biliyenko, told reporters after the hearing today that he learned of his clientâ€™s disappearance at the court hearing. He said he had not seen his client since Monday and did not know whether Moskalyov had fled. He told Reuters: At the moment, to be honest, Iâ€™m in a state of shock. He said the defence would appeal against the courtâ€™s verdict and that Moskalyovâ€™s daughter, Maria, would remain in a state-run shelter for the time being. While the panel discussion continues in Washington DC, where Franceâ€™s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna , and the Czech Republicâ€™s foreign minister, Jan LipavskÃ½, have also spoken, Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was due to appear, has posted to Telegram. He has said he has visited Sumy, posting: Sumy region. Our border. [I] observed the service of the border guards holding the frontiers of the state. Ukrainian border guards work in close cooperation with other components of the defence forces of Ukraine to protect the state border from the enemy. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister, has been addressing a summit on democracy in Washington DC, and has been outlining again Ukraineâ€™s peace plan. The key points he has made so far include saying: Although Russia seeks to destroy Ukraine, its aggression is not only about Ukraine. Russia also aims to destroy the world order based on international law and the UN Charter. Our sons and daughters have not only been fighting for the future, but also defending our common democratic values at the cost of their lives. In this fight, we are defending the entire democratic world. No other nation wants peace more than Ukraine. But peace at any cost is an illusion. I would like to emphasise that the Ukrainian people will accept peace only if it guarantees the cessation of Russian aggression in full the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory and the restoration of our stateâ€™s territorial integrity within internationally recognised borders. He went on to say later: â€œI want to be clear, Russia has to withdraw from every square metre of Ukrainian territory. There should be no misinterpretation of what the word withdrawal implies.â€? Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, responded by saying that calls for a ceasefire were appealing â€“ â€œwho wouldnâ€™t want the guns to be silentâ€? â€“ but risked freezing the conflict and allowing Russia to consolidate its territorial gains at Ukraineâ€™s expense. In his opening address in Washington DC, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken has restated the US position on potential future peace in Ukraine. He said: The US is committed to supporting meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve this. We all know that for peace to be just, it must uphold the principles at the heart of the UN charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and for peace to be durable. It must ensure that Russia canâ€™t simply rest and refit its troops, and then relaunch the war at a time more advantageous to it. Ukraine under president Zelenskiy has put forward a proposal that would force such a peace. It would end the war and save countless lives. It would restore Ukraineâ€™s territory, and respect its democracy, would reconstruct the country and the economy. It would ensure that radiation and nuclear safety. It would uphold the UN Charter and the will of the international community. And it would come to the aid of billions around the world that have been affected by Russiaâ€™s aggression. Thereâ€™s been a change of plan at the summit, and Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has appeared, carrying Volodymyr Zelenskiyâ€™s apologies, saying that you will have seen in the news that Ukraineâ€™s president is visiting frontline regions in Ukraine. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken is chairing an event entitled â€œA Just and Lasting Peace in Ukraineâ€?, and the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to join the event virtually. It is part of a summit for democracy event being held in Washington DC. You will be able to watch a live stream on this blog. You may need to refresh the page for the play button to appear. The session is just starting. Polandâ€™s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Belarus will certainly face further EU sanctions resulting from Vladimir Putinâ€™s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The Russian president said on Saturday that he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, who he said had â€œlong raised the questionâ€? of a nuclear deployment on his countryâ€™s territory. The Belarusian foreign ministry justified its decision to cooperate with Russia in a statement today, saying Minsk was acting to protect itself after years of pressure from the US and its allies aimed at changing its political and geopolitical direction. Morawiecki, at a news conference in Bucharest, said: This step taken by Russia... the announcement of the deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus, will certainly lead to the announcement of additional sanctions, the level of sanctions will be much more severe for the Lukashenko regime. The US has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into â€œa nuclear hostageâ€?. Aa senior Biden administration official has said there were no signs Moscow planned to use its nuclear weapons. Morawiecki said he was in daily talks with other EU leaders about an 11th package of sanctions against Russia and that it would include more measures targeting Belarus. In February, Poland announced it would close a key border crossing with Belarus amid rising tensions after a journalist of Polish origin was sentenced to eight years in prison by a Belarusian court in a trial Warsaw says was politically motivated. Poland was considering further limitations on cross-border traffic, Morawiecki said today. He added: We border Belarus and, as part of our bilateral relations, we are considering tightening the parameters of passenger and freight traffic in order to send a signal that we do not accept actions that serve Russia in its aggressive actions in Ukraine. A Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine has been sentenced to two years in a penal colony, according to a rights group. Alexei Moskalyov, a single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, was convicted on Tuesday of discrediting the armed forces, the OVD-Info rights group said. He has been separated from his daughter, Maria, since he was placed under house arrest and she was taken into a state-run shelter last month. Moskalyov was convicted over comments he had posted online about the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. But the investigation last April when Maria, a sixth-grader, refused to participate in a patriotic class at her school and made several drawings showing rockets being fired at a family standing under a Ukrainian flag and another that said: â€œGlory to Ukraine!â€? School officials summoned the police, who questioned the girl and threatened her father. Moskalyov was subsequently fined about Â£350 for a post online in which he characterised the Russian army as â€œrapistsâ€?. The remarks came since revelations of alleged war crimes committed against civilians at Bucha in Ukraine. The case has provoked an outcry among Russian human rights activists and sparked an online campaign to reunite the father and daughter. The banned rights group Memorial said it considered Moskalyov to be a political prisoner. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Ukraineâ€™s northern Sumy region during his tour of areas of the country that have borne the brunt of Russiaâ€™s invasion. Zelenskiy met officials and local residents in the city of Okhtyrka, which had fierce battles last year but was never occupied, and Trostianets, which was occupied by Russian forces for a month and liberated in March 2022, Associated Press reports. During the past seven days, the Ukrainian leader has visited the Kherson and Kharkiv regions, parts of which were retaken last year from Russia, to the frontline area near Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region, and to Zaporizhzhia in the south. Addressing a crowd of people on a square in Okhtyrka, he promised that the city would be rebuilt. Zelenskiy said: We wonâ€™t let any wound remain on the body of our state. In Trostianets, Zelensky honoured soldiers at the local railway station, where Ukrainian authorities say the Russians tortured prisoners. One resident told the AP that the presidentâ€™s visit to the city meant a lot to him, adding: Itâ€™s a symbol of unity and the iron will that brought the country together. Ukraineâ€™s frontline city of Avdiivka â€œis being wiped off the face of the Earthâ€? amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a â€œsecond Bakhmutâ€?. About 2,000 civilians remain in Avdiivka, a Donetsk region city about 90km (56 miles) south-west of the besieged Bakhmut, according to officials. The city had a prewar population of more than 30,000. Starting on Sunday, the cityâ€™s utilities will begin to be shut off as â€œmore and more of the town is shelled and destroyed daily,â€? said Vitaliy Barabash, the cityâ€™s military administration head. He added: The town is being wiped off the face of the Earth. Barabash, in a Telegram post yesterday, said Russian forces were turning Avdiivka into â€œa place from post-apocalyptic moviesâ€?. Germanyâ€™s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. After months of prevaricating, the German government announced in late January it would provide Kyiv with the state-of-the-art fighting vehicles as part of a deal under which several EU states would contribute to a shipment of two Leopard 2 battalions and 31 American-made M1A2 Abrams tanks from the US. Berlin had promised 14 vehicles but increased that to 18 in order to make up the numbers of a Ukrainian battalion, with Portugal contributing three tanks and Sweden 10. Poland has supplied Ukraine with a battalion of the older Leopard 2 A4 model. â€œAs promised, our tanks have arrived on time in the hands of our Ukrainian friendsâ€?, Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, said on Monday night. â€œI am sure that they can make the difference on the front.â€? The vehicles were handed over at the Ukrainian border at the end of last week, the news magazine Der Spiegel reported, adding that 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles and two tank recovery vehicles promised by Berlin have also arrived in Ukraine. For security reasons, the German government would not comment on the route by which the tanks were delivered. Kyiv, which had a limited numbers of tanks from the Soviet or post-Soviet era, has said it urgently needs heavier armour for its defence against Russiaâ€™s invasion, with the German-made Kampfpanzer Leopard 2 at the top of its list. Read the full story here: One evening in late December, as Muscovites strolled along their cityâ€™s brightly lit streets in anticipation of the end-of-year celebrations, a group of old friends gathered for dinner at the flat of a senior state official. Some of the guests present, which included members of Russiaâ€™s cultural and political elite, toasted a new year in which they expressed hope for peace and a return to normality. As the night went on, a man who needed little introduction stood up for a toast, holding his glass. â€œI am guessing you are expecting me to say something,â€? said Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putinâ€™s longtime spokesperson, according to one of the two people who separately recounted the evening to the Guardian under conditions of anonymity. â€œThings will get much harder. This will take a very, very long time,â€? Peskov continued. His toast darkened the mood of the evening among the guests, many of whom have said in private that they oppose the war in Ukraine. One guest said: It was uncomfortable to hear his speech. It was clear that he was warning that the war will stay with us and we should prepare for the long haul. Read the full story by my colleagues Pjotr Sauer and Andrew Roth: Nearly 4,400 Ukrainian orphans and children are held â€œdeprived of parental careâ€? in Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, according to Ukraineâ€™s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. Vereshchuk accused Russia of concealing information about the children, and said Kyiv had deployed a wide range of government agencies to supply evidence to the international criminal court (ICC), which has issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin and his childrenâ€™s rights commissioner, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, for the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children. She added: Thereâ€™s already enough evidence. We hope our efforts and pressure from the international community will speed up the process of returning our children. The UK and Poland will build two temporary villages in western and central Ukraine to provide housing for people who have been forced from their homes by Russiaâ€™s invasion, the UK government has said. The villages in Lviv and Poltava will offer accommodation for more than 700 Ukrainians, a fraction of the millions either displaced in Ukraine or who have fled the country since the war began more than a year ago. The UK has announced up to Â£10m in funding to support the partnership, which will deliver temporary shelters, energy supplies and assistance to those who have fled heavy fighting on the frontlines or lost their homes because of Russian shelling. In a statement, the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said: For the past year, Putin has continued to target civilian homes and infrastructure, with the Ukrainian people paying a heavy price. This new UK-Poland partnership will help bring light, heat and homes to those most in need. The international community is resolute in our shared determination to support the Ukrainian people and see them prevail with a just peace on Ukrainian terms. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires of the aftermath of recent shelling in the Russian-controlled parts of the Donetsk region. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said in a video posted on Tuesday. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. â€œAs of today, our main task is to wear down the overwhelming forces of the enemy and inflict heavy losses on them. It will create the necessary conditions to help liberate Ukrainian land and speed up our victory.â€? Russian forces launched 24 airstrikes, 12 missile strikes and carried out 55 attacks from rocket salvo systems in the last 24 hours, according the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. Several explosions were reported in Kyiv on Monday night, according to the mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko. Klitschko said a shop caught fire in the west but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Kyiv air defence said it shot down all drones involved. A cultural centre and a childrenâ€™s playground, as well as five private houses, were hit in the border village of Chernatske in Sumy, while a hospital was struck in the Dnipro district of Kherson. Possible drone attacks against vital energy infrastructure are a serious threat to Russiaâ€™s energy security, energy minister Nikolai Shulginov said on Tuesday. Shulginov did not mention Ukraine by name, but Russia says it has foiled a number of attempted Ukrainian drone attacks in recent months. Oleksii Reznikov, the Ukrainian defence minister, posted a video thanking the UK for the first British Challenger 2 main battle tanks to arrive in Ukraine. â€œThese fantastic machines will soon begin their combat missions,â€? he wrote on Twitter. The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, confirmed the arrival of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks in Ukraine on Monday. Belarusâ€™s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it had been forced to house Russian nuclear weapons on its territory by the aggressive actions of Nato countries that were threatening Belarusâ€™s own security. Romania and Poland are in talks with the European Commission over export tracing mechanisms for Ukrainian grain to ensure local farmers are not hurt by a flood of cheap Ukrainian imports, the Polish and Romanian prime ministers said on Tuesday. Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday that Russia needed to focus on boosting energy exports to so-called â€œfriendlyâ€? countries, as he said Russian oil supplies to India jumped 22-fold last year. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. LÃ©onie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it would keep demanding an international investigation into explosions that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea last year, after failing to win United Nations backing for an investigation. Reuters reports that Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in his regular daily media briefing that everyone should be interested in an impartial investigation in order to find the culprits. On Monday, Russia failed to get the UN security council to ask for an independent inquiry into explosions in September that ruptured the Nord Stream gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany and spewed gas into the Baltic Sea. Romania and Poland are in talks with the European Commission over export tracing mechanisms for Ukrainian grain to ensure local farmers are not hurt by a flood of cheap imports, the Polish and Romanian prime ministers said on Tuesday. Ukraine, one of the worldâ€™s largest grain exporters, has had its Black Sea ports blocked since Russia invaded more than a year ago and has been forced to find alternative shipping routes through EU states Poland and Romania. But Reuters reports that logistical bottlenecks mean that large quantities of Ukrainian grain, which is cheaper than that produced in the European Union, has ended up in central European states, hurting prices and sales of local farmers. Romanian and Polish prime ministers Nicolae CiucÄƒ and Mateusz Morawiecki told a business conference in Bucharest their governments were working on solutions with the EU. Oleksii Reznikov, the Ukrainian defence minister, gave the UK the thumbs up as he took a ride in what he said was the first British Challenger 2 main battle tank to arrive in Ukraine. The UK said in January it would send 14 of the tanks to Ukraine, which is preparing for a possible counteroffensive against Russian forces that invaded 13 months ago. Reuters reports Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the tanks had â€œrecently arrived in our countryâ€? and posted a video that showed him sitting in one of a long line of tanks in an open field, all of them flying Ukraineâ€™s yellow and blue flag. â€œIt was a pleasure to take the first Ukrainian Challenger 2 MBT [main battle tank] for a spin,â€? Reznikov wrote. â€œThese fantastic machines will soon begin their combat missions.â€? In the video, he gave the thumbs up sign and thanked British defence secretary Ben Wallace for the tanks. â€œMarvellous, Ben,â€? he said in English. â€œItâ€™s â€¦ very good stuff. Thank you very much from Ukraine to the United Kingdom.â€? Possible drone attacks against vital energy infrastructure are a serious threat to Russiaâ€™s energy security, energy minister Nikolai Shulginov said on Tuesday. Reuters reports Shulginov did not mention Ukraine by name, but Russia says it has foiled a number of attempted Ukrainian drone attacks in recent months. Ukraine has not publicly acknowledged launching attacks against targets inside Russia, but senior officials in Kyiv have on occasion appeared to welcome the news of successful drone attacks on Russian soil. â€œThe key threat now is acts of illegal interference through the use of unmanned aerial vehicles,â€? Shulginov said during a roundtable discussion where he addressed the security of Russiaâ€™s energy facilities. He said he was cooperating with Russiaâ€™s defence ministry and FSB security service on the issue. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said in a video posted on Tuesday. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. Moscow sees capturing Bakhmut as vital in its efforts to establish complete control over the Donbas industrial region in eastern Ukraine. â€œThey do not stop trying to surround and capture the city,â€? Reuters report Syrskyi said in the video posted on the Telegram messaging app. â€œAs of today, our main task is to wear down the overwhelming forces of the enemy and inflict heavy losses on them. It will create the necessary conditions to help liberate Ukrainian land and speed up our victory.â€? Bakhmut had a prewar population of about 70,000 people but the city has been virtually destroyed in about eight months of intense fighting, often at close quarters. Syrskyi has been meeting troops near the frontline as Ukraine prepares for a possible counteroffensive after 13 months of war. He said on Monday the defence of Bakhmut was a military necessity. Syrskyi said his visits to meet troops near the frontline were needed for him and his commanders to agree on plans that would have â€œreal results on the battlefield but not on the mapsâ€?. Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday that Russia needed to focus on boosting energy exports to so-called â€œfriendlyâ€? countries, as he said Russian oil supplies to India jumped 22-fold last year. Reuters reports Novak said energy revenues accounted for 42% of Russiaâ€™s federal budget in 2022 and said the countryâ€™s energy industry was sustainable, despite the challenges faced by western sanctions. Suspilne, Ukraineâ€™s state broadcaster, reports on its official Telegram channel that a hospital in Kherson has been struck overnight. Citing officials from the local administration, it writes: Around 4 oâ€™clock in the morning, Russian troops shelled a hospital in the Dnipro district of Kherson. There were at least five explosions. One of the shells hit the fifth floor of the building. The blast wave knocked out almost all the windows in the main building on one side. The claims have not been independently verified. Belarusâ€™s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it had been forced to house Russian nuclear weapons on its territory by the aggressive actions of Nato countries that were threatening Belarusâ€™s own security, Reuters reports, citing Russian news agency Tass. Minsk also said the plans â€“ announced over the weekend by Vladimir Putin â€“ to station Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, would not contravene international non-proliferation agreements as Belarus would not have control over the weapons. Tass quotes the ministry saying: Military cooperation between Belarus and Russia is carried out in strict accordance with international law. The training of Belarusian pilots capable of flying aircraft with specific ammunition, the modernisation of such aircraft, as well as the deployment of nuclear warheads on the territory of Belarus without transferring control over them to Minsk, as well as access to appropriate technology, do not in any way contradict the provisions of articles I and II of the non-proliferation treaty. The ministry said it was forced to respond because â€œunilateral coercive measures in politics and the economy are accompanied by the buildup of military potential in the territory of neighboring countries â€“ Nato members in close proximity to our borders. Considering these circumstances and the legitimate concerns and risks in the field of national security arising from them, Belarus is taking forced response actions to strengthen its own security and defence capability.â€? It also noted that Belarus regards the actions of the west as â€œdirect and gross interference in the internal affairs of an independent state, aimed at changing the geopolitical course and changing the internal political system of Belarusâ€?. State-owned Russian news agency Tass is reporting this morning some words from Denis Pushilin, the Russian-installed head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic, about the situation in Bakhmut. Tass quotes Pushilin on the Soloviev Live TV channel on Tuesday saying: Now [Wagner mercenary group troops] have created unbearable conditions for the enemy to even carefully try to bring up combat kits, bring up reserves, take out even the wounded â€“ all this is extremely difficult for the enemy, because all the roads are already being shot through by [Wagner mercenary troops]. As for the city itself, here it was important to clean up the industrial zone at the Azom plant itself. Pretty much we can already talk about this, the guys there are finishing off the militants, but those are single groups. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian state media has previously reported that Wagner forces were in full control of the Azom metallurgical plant in the north of the city. Suspilne, Ukraineâ€™s state broadcaster, reports on its official Telegram channel that this morning the border village of Chernatske in Sumy oblast has been struck. It writes: â€œTwenty hits were recorded, probably from barrel artillery. The infrastructure of the village was damaged â€“ a cultural centre and a childrenâ€™s playground, as well as five private houses.â€? The UK Ministry of Defence says Russiaâ€™s 10th tank regiment has borne the brunt of the assault of Avdiivka and has likely lost a â€œlarge portion of its tanksâ€? while attempting to surround the town from the south. It said the regiment belonged to the 3rd Army Corps, the first major new formation Russia stood up to support its invasion since August 2022 and despite a period of training in Belarus, the formation â€œappears to display limited combat effectivenessâ€?. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian forces launched 24 airstrikes, 12 missile strikes and carried out 55 attacks from rocket salvo systems in the last 24 hours, according the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. A missile strike in the city of Slovyansk damaged high-rise buildings and private houses, causing deaths and injuries among civilians â€“ although numbers were not immediately available. A separate airstrike in the city of Bersyslav also caused damaged to civilian infrastructure. According to the update, Russian forces also carried out attacks with 15 Shahed-136 type strike UAVs. 14 of them were destroyed by our defenders. In the same period, the Ukrainian air force carried out nine strikes against Russian forces and one attack on an anti-aircraft missile complex. Ukrainian solders also shot down five reconnaissance drones of various types. Rocket forces and artillery also struck three control points and areas of concentration, an artillery unit in firing position, an ammunition warehouse, a fuel warehouse and â€œtwo more important targetsâ€?. The claims have not been independently verified. The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, confirmed the arrival of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks in Ukraine on Monday. In a post to Twitter, Pistorius said he believed the tanks would make a â€œcrucial difference at the frontâ€?. The arrival of the tanks follow the delivery of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks provided by Germany on Monday along with 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles. Britainâ€™s Challenger tanks have arrived in Ukraine, a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Kyiv said on Monday. Spokesperson for the Ukrainian ministry of defence, Iryna Zolotar, told the AFP that the tanks had been received. They are in Ukraine already. No further details were provided. The tanks are expected to be involved in any spring counter-offensive launched by Ukraine. Ukraineâ€™s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, said earlier on Monday he inspected a â€œnew additionâ€? to the countryâ€™s forces â€“ Challenger tanks as well as Germanyâ€™s Marder infantry fighting vehicles, plus Cougar armoured trucks and Stryker armoured personnel carriers from the US. A year ago, no one would have thought that our partnersâ€™ support would be so strong. The ISW also said higher quality Wagner units have likely been committed to fighting around Avdiivka â€œpotentially to reinforce recent limited tactical successes in the areaâ€?. The ISW said the deployments appear intended to help support weaker units from the Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic and that if confirmed, their involvement may help â€œexplain the limited tactical gains made in the area over the past weekâ€?. The Institute for Study of War (ISW) says it has been monitoring chattering among Russian military bloggers about the dismissal of Russian military commanders overseeing troops in combat zones. Rumours have been circulating that Rusam Muradov has been dismissed as Eastern Military District Commander, and Yevgeny Nikiforov has been replaced as Western Military District Commander. The ISW could not confirm either change in leadership but said it was, â€œnoteworthy that Russian millbloggers are discussing potential dismissals of commanders associated with areas of operation in which Russian forces have been largelyunable to secure substantial gains or have suffered major lossesâ€?. The UN security council on Monday declined a Russian request to investigate the blasts on the pipelines that move natural gas from Russia to Europe under the Baltic Sea. Russia, China and Brazil voted in favour of the Russian request, but other security council members abstained or said another investigation was unnecessary. For a resolution to be adopted by the security council, it needs a minimum of nine â€œyesâ€? votes in the 15-member council, and no veto by one of the permanent members â€“ the US, Russia, China, Britain and France. The US deputy ambassador, Robert Wood, said there was no need for a UN investigation when inquiries by Sweden, Denmark and Germany â€œare proceeding in a comprehensive, transparent and impartial mannerâ€?. It was an attempt to discredit the work of ongoing national investigations and prejudice any conclusions they reached that do not comport to Russiaâ€™s predetermined and political narrative. It was not an attempt to seek the truth. The pipelines, known as Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, are majority-owned by Russiaâ€™s state-run energy giant Gazprom. Nord Stream 1 carried Russian gas to Germany until Moscow cut off supplies at the end of August 2022. Nord Stream 2 never entered service as Germany suspended its certification process shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The explosions on both occurred on 26 September. The investigations by European nations have yet to yield conclusive results, at least none made public. AP Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine â€“ this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. Multiple explosions were reported in Kyiv on Monday night following a drone attack, according to the mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko. Klitschko said a shop caught fire in the west but there were no immediate reports of casualties with Kyiv air defence reporting it had shot down all 13 Russian drones involved in the attack. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraineâ€™s president has told IAEA head, Rafael Grossi, that safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility could not be guaranteed until Russian troops left. Zelenskiy also â€œvisited advanced positionsâ€? in the Zaporizhzhia region on Monday. The pair met to discuss the management of Europeâ€™s largest nuclear power plant where Zelenskiy told him he could not guarantee the security of the facility so long as the area remained occupied by Russian troops. British challenger tanks are â€œin Ukraine alreadyâ€? according to Ukrainian defence minister Iryna Zolotar, no further details provided AFP reports. The arrival of the tanks follow the delivery of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks provided by Germany on Monday along with 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles. In other developments: Zelenskiy also spoke with the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda to discuss the ongoing war and â€œcurrent defense needs of Ukraine and joint diplomatic efforts for the near futureâ€?. Russian navy vessels have fired supersonic anti-ship missiles at a mock target in the Sea of Japan. The Russian defence ministry reported the exercises on Tuesday, saying â€œthe target, located at a distance of about 100 kilometres, was successfully hit by a direct hit from two Moskit cruise missiles.â€? Ukraineâ€™s ground forces commander said his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a â€œmilitary necessityâ€?. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyiâ€™s comments signalled again Ukraineâ€™s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll. At least two people were killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko said, adding that a number of high-rise buildings and offices were damaged or destroyed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a video clip that showed vehicles on fire and debris strewn across the road. Western companies selling their Russian businesses and leaving face a compulsory 10% direct donation to the government, the Financial Times has reported, after a ruling by Russiaâ€™s foreign investments commission. The chair of Ukraineâ€™s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, has told British lawmakers that Kyiv is ready to send its pilots to be trained in the use of western fighter jets. Stefanchuk, speaking during a visit to the UK, said Kyiv could bring â€œjoint victory for Ukraine and the worldâ€? once it â€œgets the wingsâ€?, in language echoing that of Volodymyr Zelenskiyâ€™s speech to the British parliament in February. A leaked phone conversation allegedly between prominent Russian music producer Iosif Prigozhin and billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, in which the two men give a far-ranging criticism of the war in Ukraine and Russiaâ€™s leadership, has been published by Ukrainian media. If genuine, the audio would provide a rare insight into the mood within the Russian elites. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland has said, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it planned to let them compete as neutrals. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors have said. The arrest comes after Poland dismantled a Russian espionage network that had been preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison. Hungaryâ€™s parliament has approved a bill to allow Finland to join Nato, bringing it one step closer to becoming a full member of the alliance. Hungarian lawmakers voted 182 for and six against with no abstentions. Turkey is the only one of Natoâ€™s 30 members not to have ratified Finlandâ€™s accession.","charCount":"55327","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/leonie-chao-fong\">LÃ©onie Chao-Fong</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/royce-kurmelovs\">Royce Kurmelovs</a> (earlier)","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/mar/29/it-would-survive-nuclear-armageddon-the-rise-and-fall-of-plastic-lawns","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T05:00:26Z","webTitle":"â€˜It would survive nuclear Armageddonâ€™: should plastic grass be banned?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/29/it-would-survive-nuclear-armageddon-the-rise-and-fall-of-plastic-lawns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/29/it-would-survive-nuclear-armageddon-the-rise-and-fall-of-plastic-lawns","fields":{"headline":"â€˜It would survive nuclear Armageddonâ€™: should plastic grass be banned?","standfirst":"<p>Artificial lawns are more popular than ever â€“ but they are also an environmental nightmare.

To be honest, itâ€™s not really a lawn at all. Any green is mostly moss, the rest is mud. More no manâ€™s land than bowling green.

It wants people to say no to fake grass. The charge sheet is a long one: artificial lawns destroy natural habitats and soil; they contribute to carbon emissions during manufacture and transport, whereas real grass absorbs CO<sub>2</sub>; they overheat in the summer and contribute to urban heat islands; they cause flooding as they absorb less than 50% of the rain that falls on them; they pollute waterways, as over time the plastic breaks down into microplastics, which is washed into our drainage and discharged into rivers and the sea; they are neither biodegradable nor recyclable, and after their life cycle (typically up to about 15 years) they go into landfill where they will continue to pollute.</p> <p>In short, they are an environmental nightmare, green in colour only. â€œEvery time you put one down, youâ€™re saying: â€˜I know weâ€™re all worried about climate change, but guess what, Iâ€™m going to contribute to it,â€™â€? says Marcus, before adding that she doesnâ€™t want to blame people. â€œItâ€™s about public engagement with the issue, informing and educating.â€?</p> <p>She rejects any idea that they are maintenance-free, explaining that over time they accumulate a buildup of excrement and urine from birds, mice, foxes, cats and dogs, and have to be regularly cleaned and disinfected.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You canâ€™t get a plastic bag, yet you can cover your garden in plastic.

The Chelsea Flower show banned fake grass last year. Ed Horne of the RHS, which runs the event, said: â€œFake grass is just not in line with our ethos and views on plastic.

In Somerset, JP put down a plastic lawn because it was a tiny patch and grass wouldnâ€™t grow. â€œWithin months it started stinking of urine due to the dog toileting on it.

To be honest, itâ€™s not really a lawn at all. Any green is mostly moss, the rest is mud. More no manâ€™s land than bowling green. The reasons for this are: small London garden (I know I am lucky to have one); not a lot of sun (stolen by the neighbourâ€™s overhanging apple tree); two footballing boys (even though, now banned for life, they have to go to the park). And possibly also inexpertise on the part of the groundsman, though he has tried â€“ Iâ€™ve turfed, and seeded, aerated, watered, fed, scarified, sung to it. Iâ€™m about ready to give up. There is an obvious solution: artificial grass. Beautifully, uniformly verdant all year round, low maintenance, no mowing required, no mower required, no watering, no mud. I might even let the boys back on to it. Or not. Iâ€™m not alone in thinking of faking it. A survey last year by Aviva found that 10% of UK homeowners with outside space had replaced at least some of their gardenâ€™s natural lawn with artificial grass, and a further 29% plan to or would consider making the swap. During the pandemic, when everyone was thinking about the outdoors, searches for â€œartificial grassâ€? jumped 185% from May 2019 to 2020, according to Google Trends. My own search finds dozens of firms offering artificial grass, seducing me with pictures of lawns that look like the green baize of snooker tables. And promises â€“ no mud, no sweat, no tears. And no guilt either â€“ hereâ€™s one that says itâ€™s â€œbetter for the environmentâ€? â€“ because you donâ€™t have to water, mow or fertilise. Well, thatâ€™s a relief, though weâ€™ll return to this later. I might miss the smell of summer: freshly cut grass. What, I donâ€™t have to? I can brush in artificial grass cleaner with that very fragrance? Happy days. Soon I have a quote for supply and installation, 40 sq metres of a mid-range product: Â£2,900 plus VAT. Ouch. But you can just buy the stuff for as little as Â£7 a sq metre â€“ how hard can it be to DIY? Artificial grass was invented by James M Faria and Robert T Wright at Monsanto and first installed on a recreation area of a school in Providence Rhode Island in 1964. It hit the headlines a couple of years later when it was laid in the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, and became known as AstroTurf. Artificial turf for sport, now produced under different brand names by other companies, has become increasingly controversial, most seriously after being potentially linked to the deaths of six professional baseball players in Philadelphia, who had the same rare form of cancer. It often uses rubber granules from recycled tyres, which can contain heavy metals, benzene and other carcinogens. Artificial grass for domestic use and landscaping, which began to be a thing in the 1990s, is normally made from polypropylene or nylon (polyamide) and doesnâ€™t often contain rubber granules. The global artificial turf market (including sports use and domestic use) grew 8.4% in the past year to $4.87 bn (Â£3.95bn) and is expected to reach $6.83 bn (Â£5.6bn) in 2027.

Tanya Plibersek, the federal environment minister, indicated she would give the green light to the Isaac River coalmine in Queenslandâ€™s Bowen basin. It was announced late on Thursday. The mine, to be developed by Bowen Coking Coal, is planned for 28km east of Moranbah, next to five other coalmines, and expected to produce about 500,000 tonnes of metallurgical coal a year for five years. Metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, is used in steelmaking. â€œThe Albanese government has to make decisions in accordance with the facts and the national environment law â€“ thatâ€™s what happens on every project, and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happened here,â€? a spokesperson for Plibersek said. â€œSince the election weâ€™ve doubled renewable energy approvals to a record high. The government will continue to consider each project on a case-by-case basis, under the law.â€? The government said no submissions had been received about the project during the public consultation period, including from environment groups. But climate campaigners had made public statements calling on Plibersek to reject the mine in line with scientific advice that no new fossil fuel developments should go ahead if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C. â€œScientists, energy and climate experts have said that the climate cannot afford new coalmines, and theyâ€™ve said it so many times Iâ€™ve lost count,â€? said Rod Campbell, research director at the Australia Institute. â€œThe fact that this is a small coking coalmine is beside the point â€“ fossil carbon needs to stay in the ground. Weâ€™ve already got more than enough coalmines approved to cook the planet, including coking coalmines that could run into next century. â€œThis approval comes late in the evening in budget week, the perfect time for controversial news.â€? The announcement comes a week after Plibersek cancelled two coal projects whose applications had lapsed. Dr Coral Rowston, the director of EnvA (Environmental Advocacy) CQ, a grassroots group in central Queensland, said the project would affect habitat for the vulnerable ornamental snake. â€œThe other key issue for us is the mine will also leave a legacy for our water quality in central Queensland due to the release of affected water from sediment dams into the Isaac River which feeds into the Great Barrier Reef.â€? Plibersek also plans to move three other projects â€“ two in New South Wales and one in Queensland â€“ to the next stage of the assessment process. The three mines are among a group of 19 proposed new coal and gas projects that Environment Justice Australia, on behalf of the Environment Council of Central Queensland, had sought to have reconsidered and effectively rejected because of their potential greenhouse gas emissions. â€œTodayâ€™s decision means minister Plibersek joins a long line of federal environment ministers who have said itâ€™s not their job to consider the climate risk of new coal and gas mines,â€? the councilâ€™s president Christine Carlisle said. The government found it could not stop the projects at this point in the process because national environmental laws state they would have to prove the emissions of a specific project would be a substantial cause of climate change effects on matters of national environmental significance. Of the remaining 16 projects, five have been withdrawn by the developers or cancelled by the government due to lapsed applications. Thursdayâ€™s decision leaves 11 still to be reconsidered by Plibersek. Environmental Justice Australia senior lawyer Retta Berryman said: â€œOur client is carefully considering all legal options in light of todayâ€™s decision â€“ including one or more federal court challenges.â€? â€¢ This article was amended on 12 May 2023 to remove a statement from Coral Rowston referring to koala and greater glider habitat. The Isaac River mine that has been approved would not affect those areas.","charCount":"3970","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lisa-cox\">Lisa Cox</a>","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/24/china-ramps-up-coal-power-despite-carbon-neutral-pledges","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-24T01:00:53Z","webTitle":"China ramps up coal power despite carbon neutral pledges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/24/china-ramps-up-coal-power-despite-carbon-neutral-pledges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/24/china-ramps-up-coal-power-despite-carbon-neutral-pledges","fields":{"headline":"China ramps up coal power despite carbon neutral pledges","standfirst":"<p>Local governments approved more coal power in first three months of 2023 than all of 2021</p>","trailText":"Local governments approved more coal power in first three months of 2023 than all of 2021","byline":"Amy Hawkins Senior China correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6baa971445efd8c063f6479545d942f6ae838d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6baa971445efd8c063f6479545d942f6ae838d7/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chimneys of a coal-fired power plant behind a gate in Shanghai, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chimneys of a coal-fired power plant behind a gate in Shanghai, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Local governments in China approved more new coal power in the first three months of 2023 than in the whole of 2021, according to official documents.</p> <p>The approvals, analysed by Greenpeace, reveal that between January and March this year, at least 20.45 gigawatts of coal power was approved, up from 8.63GW in the same period in 2022.

The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to unveil the plan on Tuesday morning AEDT, with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden. The Australian government estimates that Aukus will support 20,000 jobs over 30 years, across the Australian Defence Force, the public service and private industry. It poses a looming challenge to educate, train and recruit the necessary personnel, but experts say Australia has a good base from which to expand its nuclear industry.

Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces defending Bakhmut and Soledar in the east would be armed with everything they need to keep Russian troops at bay in some of the bloodiest fighting of the war. Hundreds of civilians remain trapped in Soledar, Ukraine has said. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk, told Ukrainian state TV that 559 civilians remained in Soledar, including 15 children, and could not be evacuated. Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies show the destruction inflicted upon Soledar. The Guardian has a series of striking images from inside the eastern Ukrainian town. Ukraine is confident Britain will announce it plans to send about 10 Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv shortly, a move it hopes will help Germany finally allow its Leopard 2s to be re-exported to the embattled country. A formal announcement is anticipated on Monday but Ukrainian sources indicated they understood that Britain had already decided in favour. Germany will continue to â€œweigh every step carefullyâ€? and consult with its allies on further weapons deliveries to Ukraine, chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. The German leader is facing mounting pressure to approve German-made battle tanks for Kyiv. Scholz said Berlin would keep its â€œleading positionâ€? as one of Kyivâ€™s top supporters but said he had no intention of being rushed on â€œsuch serious things that have to do with peace and war, with the security of our country and of Europeâ€?.","charCount":"2474","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"Guardian staff","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-271of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-21T15:01:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 271 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-271of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-271of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 271 of the invasion","standfirst":"<p>Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday, Zelenskiy says; UN nuclear watchdog to assess Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">See all our Ukraine coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday, Zelenskiy says; UN nuclear watchdog to assess Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant","byline":"Samantha Lock, Tom Ambrose and LÃ©onie Chao-Fong","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fefaea07e517dcd8683d0518a6b694351a50c553\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fefaea07e517dcd8683d0518a6b694351a50c553/0_63_2609_1565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukrainian soldiers fire artillery at Russian positions near Bakhmut, in Ukraineâ€™s Donetsk region, on Sunday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukrainian soldiers fire artillery at Russian positions near Bakhmut, in Ukraineâ€™s Donetsk region, on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Libkos/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<ul> <li><p><strong>Ukraine is to evacuate civilians from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. </strong>Residents of the two southern regions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/21/ukraine-evacuations-kherson-mykolaiv-regions-winter-war-damage-infrastructure\">have been advised</a> to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraineâ€™s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire</strong>, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday night <a href=\"https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/cogorich-svit-pobachiv-yakim-vagomim-ye-vnesok-ukrayinciv-u-79305\">address</a>. â€œThe fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region.

The Australian government still plans to extend the life of some of these six conventional submarines, but the Aukus plans means it may not be necessary to carry out expensive upgrades on all of them.</p> \n<p>The third phase of the program involves the design and construction of a submarine to be known as the â€œSSN Aukusâ€?, to be based on a UK design but incorporate US technology â€“ as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say\">the Guardian foreshadowed last week</a>.</p> \n<p>â€œAustraliaâ€™s long-term submarine will be a state-of-the-art platform that uses the best of US, UK and Australian technologies,â€? the official said.</p> \n<p>â€œSSN Aukus will be built and deployed by both Australia and the UK.

The program is forecast to cost $268bn to $368bn between now and the mid 2050s, most of it beyond the first four-year budget period, and will depend on help from the US and the UK. As part of the multidecade nuclear-powered submarine plan unveiled on Tuesday, Australian taxpayers will pour â€œsubstantialâ€? funds into expanding American shipbuilding capacity, understood to be about $3bn in the first four years. Australiaâ€™s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said Aukus plan marked â€œa new chapterâ€? in the relationship between the three countries, as he joined the US president, Joe Biden, and the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, for the announcement in San Diego. â€œThe Aukus agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australiaâ€™s defence capability in our history,â€? Albanese said. Without directly naming China as a source of concern, Albanese said the plan reflected a shared determination to ensure all countries could â€œact in their sovereign interests free from coercionâ€?. He said his government was â€œalso determined to promote security by investing in our relationships across our regionâ€?. In a bid to reassure partners across the Indo-Pacific, Biden said it was important to note the Australian submarines would be nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed. â€œI want to be clear from the outset â€“ right off the bat â€“ so thereâ€™s no confusion or misunderstanding on this critical point,â€? Biden said. â€œAustralia is a proud non-nuclear weapons state, and itâ€™s committed to stay that way.â€? Australia would invite â€œrotational forcesâ€? of US and UK submarines to visit the country from 2027. The first Australian-built nuclear-powered submarines, fitted with vertical launch systems to fire cruise missiles, are due to enter into service in the early 2040s. The British-designed submarine â€œwill incorporate US technology such as propulsion plant systems and components, a common vertical launch system and weaponsâ€?, an Australian government fact sheet said. â€œThe Aukus partners will also develop a joint combat system as an expansion of the US-Australia combat system.â€? The plan begins with increased visits by US submarines to Australian ports this year. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâ€™s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup From 2027 at the earliest, the UK and the US plan to establish a rotational presence of one UK Astute class submarine and up to four US Virginia class submarines at HMAS Stirling near Perth, Western Australia. This will be called â€œSubmarine Rotational Force-Westâ€? (SRF-West). The Australian government argues this rotational presence â€œwill comply fully with Australiaâ€™s longstanding position of no foreign bases on its territoryâ€? because these submarines will be rotated through the location and will not be permanently based in Australia. The three countries argue the rotational presence will â€œput our nations shoulder to shoulder as Australia builds the necessary operational capabilities and skills to steward and operate its own fleet of nuclear-powered submarinesâ€?. The US and UK submarines would operate as sovereign assets under the command of, respectively, American and British commanders, but there would be â€œa significant degree of coordination in their activitiesâ€?, a senior Biden administration official said. Beginning in the early 2030s, the US intends to sell Australia three Virginia class submarines, with the potential to sell up to two more if needed, pending approval from the US Congress. The three governments argue this is â€œcritical to continue growing Australiaâ€™s ability to own and operateâ€? a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines and to ensure Australia does not experience any capability gap when its Collins class diesel-electric submarines are retired from the 2030s. The Australian government still plans to extend the life of some of these six conventional submarines, but the Aukus plans means it may not be necessary to carry out expensive upgrades on all of them. The third phase of the program involves the design and construction of a submarine to be known as the â€œSSN Aukusâ€?, to be based on a UK design but incorporate US technology â€“ as the Guardian foreshadowed last week. â€œAustraliaâ€™s long-term submarine will be a state-of-the-art platform that uses the best of US, UK and Australian technologies,â€? the official said. â€œSSN Aukus will be built and deployed by both Australia and the UK. The United Kingdom intends to deliver its first SSN Aukus domestically in the late 2030s. Australia intends to deliver the first SSN Aukus built in Australia to the Royal Australian Navy in the early 2040s. â€œThis is going to require significant improvements in industrial bases in all three countries.â€? Senior Biden administration officials said the budget commitment from Australia towards the US industrial base was â€œanother manifestation of just how serious and critical this effort isâ€?. The $3bn would help the US reduce work backlogs on its own Virginia class submarines, and expand its production ability. The funding for US domestic production could be a point of tension in Australia at a time when the budget is facing pressure on multiple fronts. The projected cost includes includes $9bn over the initial four-year budget period, or an increase of $3bn compared with the $6bn earmarked for the abandoned French project. Defence is being asked to offset that $3bn, which could come through changes to other defence projects. Australian officials believe it is hard to estimate the cost over the life of the program, but have predicted a range based on all costs including acquisition and sustainment. The long-term cost of the submarine plan is likely to be about 0.15% of Australiaâ€™s gross domestic product per year on average, compared with Laborâ€™s pre-election overall pledge to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence annually. The Coalitionâ€™s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, earlier offered bipartisan support to the overall Aukus deal, saying it is â€œtruly a multigenerational nation-building task for the Australian peopleâ€? and that it â€œcannot failâ€?. Hastie also acknowledged the Aukus project would require some â€œhard choicesâ€? in the budget because â€œmoney doesnâ€™t grow on treesâ€?.","charCount":"6422","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/daniel-hurst\">Daniel Hurst</a> and <a href=\"profile/julianborger\">Julian Borger</a>","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/mar/23/first-thing-situation-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-perilous-un-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T10:50:32Z","webTitle":"Situation at Zaporizhzhia plant â€˜perilousâ€™, UN warns | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/23/first-thing-situation-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-perilous-un-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/mar/23/first-thing-situation-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-perilous-un-warns","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: situation at Zaporizhzhia plant â€˜perilousâ€™, UN warns","standfirst":"<p>Nuclear plant relies on single backup power line; EU leaders to discuss Ukraineâ€™s armament needs; plus, 10 writers face their fiercest food fears</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed\">Donâ€™t already get First Thing in your inbox?

The plantâ€™s lack of access to the grid and necessary repair work on its last emergency power line could cause a complete loss of power, making it reliant on diesel generators for the seventh time since Russia captured it a year ago, Grossi said. What else is happening? President Vladimir Putinâ€™s ally Dmitry Medvedev has said this morning that any attempt to arrest Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for him would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. US navy rejects China claim that warship â€˜illegallyâ€™ entered part of South China Sea The US has denied Chinese claims that a US destroyer was driven out from waters around the contested Paracel Islands after it â€œillegallyâ€? entered the area in the South China Sea. In a statement on Thursday, the Chinese military said the guided-missile destroyer USS Milius illegally intruded into Chinaâ€™s territorial waters without the approval of the government, undermining peace and stability in the busy waterway. The US navy, however, said this was false. â€œThe USS Milius is conducting routine operations in the South China Sea and was not expelled. The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,â€? a statement from the US Navy 7th Fleet said. Where are the Paracel Islands? They are a disputed archipelago spread across about 7 sq km in the South China Sea. China has de facto control of the islands and has built installations and outposts, but Taiwan and Vietnam also claim ownership. What did the US say? The USâ€™s Indo-Pacific Command at the time said Chinaâ€™s statement was â€œfalseâ€? and that the US ship was conducting a freedom of navigation operation (Fonop) in line with international law. The Fonop sought to challenge restrictions imposed by various parties â€“ including China, Taiwan and Vietnam â€“ on â€œinnocent passageâ€? through the disputed area, and to challenge Chinaâ€™s claim of straight baselines that enclose the Paracel Islands. Trump lawyer ordered to hand over notes in Mar-a-Lago documents inquiry Donald Trumpâ€™s main lawyer â€“ who was involved in turning over classified-marked documents at the Mar-a-Lago resort to the justice department last year â€“ must provide his notes and audio transcripts to the criminal investigation into the former president after a federal appeals court rejected two efforts to block the order. The US appeals court for the DC circuit rejected on Wednesday two separate appeals from the former president and his lawyer Evan Corcoran to stop a sealed order, piercing attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine protections issued in a court decision last week. In losing the appeal â€“ a major defeat for Trump â€“ Corcoran must provide additional testimony and produce documents to the grand jury hearing evidence about Trumpâ€™s potential unauthorized retention of national security materials at Mar-a-Lago, and possible obstruction of justice. The obstruction part of the investigation is centered on Trumpâ€™s incomplete compliance with a subpoena in May that demanded the return of any classified-marked documents in his possession. That was after documents he returned earlier to the National Archives included 200 that were classified. What is happening in the Dominion case? The full trial in the case is scheduled to begin on 17 April but one side may have won already, argues Sam Levine. The core of Dominionâ€™s $1.6bn case against Fox consists of words that came from the mouths of Foxâ€™s employees. Regardless of what happens in the case, Dominion may have already won: the messages offer a significant historical record of how top officials at one of the countryâ€™s most powerful media organizations aired information they knew was false when US democracy was under attack.

A Chinese startup has invented a long-distance kissing machine that transmits usersâ€™ kiss data collected through motion sensors hidden in silicon lips, which simultaneously move when replaying kisses received. Mua â€“ named after the sound people commonly make when blowing a kiss â€“ also captures and replays sounds and warms up slightly during kissing. The chief executive of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, faces a grilling from US lawmakers today as the political storm surrounding the China-owned social media platform intensifies, with the Biden administration threatening to ban the app in the US. Stat of the day: US Federal Reserve raises interest rates a quarter-point amid banking turmoil Facing the worst banking crisis since 2008 and the highest inflation rate in a generation, the Federal Reserve chose to keep fighting price rises and announced another hike in interest rates. The US central bank announced yesterday that its benchmark interest rate would rise another quarter of a percentage point to a range of 4.75% to 5% â€“ its ninth consecutive rate rise and the highest rate since 2007. A year ago interest rates were close to zero. The latest increase was smaller than the half-point increase that some had expected before a series of bank collapses shook global markets. In a statement, the Fed said the impact of the banking crisis was â€œuncertainâ€? but that inflation â€œremains elevatedâ€?. Donâ€™t miss this: â€˜Youâ€™ve never eaten a banana?!â€™ Ten writers face their fiercest â€“ and strangest â€“ food fears Whether it is the smell, the texture or the emotional associations, something has kept our guinea pigs away from everyday dishes such as hard-boiled eggs and shepherdâ€™s pie. How traumatic will those first mouthfuls be? It should be perfectly obvious to everyone that bananas are repulsive, writes Arwa Mahdawi. Theyâ€™re mushy, theyâ€™re musty, theyâ€™re alarmingly yellow. I wouldnâ€™t go so far as to say I have bananaphobia (a rare but real condition), but for a long time I was so nauseated by the fruit that you couldnâ€™t have paid me a million dollars to touch one. Now, however, I have accepted a far smaller sum to try one. Is this personal growth, or an abandonment of personal dignity? Climate check: new climate paper calls big US oil firms to be charged with homicide Oil companies have come under increasing legal scrutiny and face allegations of defrauding investors, racketeering and a wave of other lawsuits. But a new paper argues thereâ€™s another way to hold big oil accountable for climate damage: trying companies for homicide. The striking and seemingly radical legal theory is laid out in a paper accepted for publication in the Harvard Environmental Law Review. In it, the authors argue fossil fuel companies â€œhave not simply been lying to the public, they have been killing members of the public at an accelerating rate, and prosecutors should bring that crime to the publicâ€™s attentionâ€?. â€œWhatâ€™s on their ledger in terms of harm â€¦ thereâ€™s nothing like it in human history,â€? said David Arkush, one of the paperâ€™s authors. Last Thing: Virginia prisoners who used toothbrush to escape caught at pancake restaurant Two prisoners in Virginia managed to escape their cell by digging a hole through a wall with the aid of a toothbrush, but were apprehended within a few hours after being tempted to visit a pancake restaurant. In a statement, the Newport News sheriffâ€™s office said two inmates were reported missing after a routine head count at about 7pm on Monday at the Newport News jail. Staff discovered that John Garza, 37, and Arley Nemo, 43, had dug a hole through a jail wall using â€œprimitive-made toolsâ€? fashioned from a toothbrush and metal objects. They then scaled a high prison wall and made their escape. However, the two men were quickly found after being spotted by members of the public at an Ihop, a branch of the pancake chain whose name is short for International House of Pancakes.

Atmospheric radiation levels have dropped, damaged reactor buildings have been reinforced and robots have identified melted fuel in the basements.</p> <p>But as the Guardian learned on a recent visit, progress on <a href=\"https://www.tepco.co.jp/en/hd/decommission/index-e.html\">decommissioning</a> â€“ a process that could take four decades â€“ is being held up by the accumulation of huge quantities of water that is used to cool the damaged reactor cores.</p> <p>Now, 1.3m tonnes of water â€“ enough to fill about 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools â€“ is being stored in 1,000 tanks that cover huge swathes of the complex. And space is running out.</p> <p>Two steel pillars protruding from the sea a kilometre from the shore mark the spot where, later this year, the plantâ€™s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], plans to begin releasing the water into the Pacific Ocean, in the most controversial step in the Fukushima Daiichi cleanup to date.</p> <p>The decision comes more than two years after Japanâ€™s government approved the release of the water, which is treated using <a href=\"https://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/decommissioning/atw.html\">on-site technology</a> to remove most radioactive materials. But the water still contains tritium, a naturally occurring radioactive form of hydrogen that is technically difficult to separate from water.</p> <p>The discharge, which is due to begin in the spring or summer, will take place in defiance of local fishing communities, who say it will destroy more than a decade of work to rebuild their industry. Neighbouring countries have also voiced opposition.</p> <p>The government and Tepco claim the environmental and health impacts will be negligible because the treated water will be released gradually after it has been diluted by large amounts of seawater. The International Atomic Energy Agency says nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides.</p> <p>Tepco and government officials who guided a small group of journalists around Fukushima Daiichi this month insisted the science supports their plans to pump the â€œtreatedâ€? water â€“ they object to media reports describing it as contaminated â€“ into the ocean.</p> <p>The water will be treated and, if necessary, treated again until the concentration of radionuclides other than tritium have fallen below government limits, said Hikaru Kuroda, a Tepco official overseeing the decontamination and decommissioning of Fukushima Daiichi. â€œBy the time the liquid is diluted with seawater, tritium levels will be at less than 1,500 becquerels per litre, or 1/40th of the government standard for discharging water into the environment,â€? he said.</p> <p>â€œWe will have contaminated water on the site for as long as we have to cool the reactor basements. And we will release the water very slowly to begin with, so we could be looking at something like 20 to 30 years to complete the process.â€?</p> <p>The fiercest opposition has come from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/16/fukushima-fisherman-fear-for-future-over-release-of-radioactive-water\">Fukushimaâ€™s fishers</a>, who say releasing the water risks destroying their livelihoods because consumers will shun their catch and send prices plummeting.</p> <p>â€œEven though it is safe, it could still harm sales of Fukushima seafood and lower prices, which is what happened 12 years ago,â€? conceded Junichi Matsumoto, Tepcoâ€™s chief officer for the management of treated water. â€œWe know fishing communities are worried â€¦ thatâ€™s why we and the government are working on addressing the potential reputational damage.â€?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5de10846c8a74ecca57cff9b64e273393f8a0046\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5de10846c8a74ecca57cff9b64e273393f8a0046/0_94_3968_2381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view shows some of the storage tanks for treated water at the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view shows some of the storage tanks for treated water at the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kyodo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Fukushima prefectural government says that, post-disaster, its <a href=\"https://www.pref.fukushima.lg.jp/site/portal-english/en01-03.html\">food safety standards</a> are among the strictest in the world.

To describe the water as contaminated is erroneous, as it implies that it will harm the environment.â€?</p> <p>The campaign has had mixed results.

As the country prepares to mark the 11 March anniversary, one of the disasterâ€™s most troubling legacies is about to come into full view with the release of more than 1m tonnes of â€œtreatedâ€? water from the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The tsunami knocked out the plantâ€™s backup electricity supply, leading to meltdowns in three of its reactors, in the worldâ€™s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl 25 years earlier. Much has changed since the Guardianâ€™s first visit to the plant in 2012, when the cleanup had barely begun and visitors were required to wear protective clothing and full-face masks. Atmospheric radiation levels have dropped, damaged reactor buildings have been reinforced and robots have identified melted fuel in the basements. But as the Guardian learned on a recent visit, progress on decommissioning â€“ a process that could take four decades â€“ is being held up by the accumulation of huge quantities of water that is used to cool the damaged reactor cores. Now, 1.3m tonnes of water â€“ enough to fill about 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools â€“ is being stored in 1,000 tanks that cover huge swathes of the complex. And space is running out. Two steel pillars protruding from the sea a kilometre from the shore mark the spot where, later this year, the plantâ€™s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], plans to begin releasing the water into the Pacific Ocean, in the most controversial step in the Fukushima Daiichi cleanup to date. The decision comes more than two years after Japanâ€™s government approved the release of the water, which is treated using on-site technology to remove most radioactive materials. But the water still contains tritium, a naturally occurring radioactive form of hydrogen that is technically difficult to separate from water. The discharge, which is due to begin in the spring or summer, will take place in defiance of local fishing communities, who say it will destroy more than a decade of work to rebuild their industry. Neighbouring countries have also voiced opposition. The government and Tepco claim the environmental and health impacts will be negligible because the treated water will be released gradually after it has been diluted by large amounts of seawater. The International Atomic Energy Agency says nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides. Tepco and government officials who guided a small group of journalists around Fukushima Daiichi this month insisted the science supports their plans to pump the â€œtreatedâ€? water â€“ they object to media reports describing it as contaminated â€“ into the ocean. The water will be treated and, if necessary, treated again until the concentration of radionuclides other than tritium have fallen below government limits, said Hikaru Kuroda, a Tepco official overseeing the decontamination and decommissioning of Fukushima Daiichi. â€œBy the time the liquid is diluted with seawater, tritium levels will be at less than 1,500 becquerels per litre, or 1/40th of the government standard for discharging water into the environment,â€? he said. â€œWe will have contaminated water on the site for as long as we have to cool the reactor basements. And we will release the water very slowly to begin with, so we could be looking at something like 20 to 30 years to complete the process.â€? The fiercest opposition has come from Fukushimaâ€™s fishers, who say releasing the water risks destroying their livelihoods because consumers will shun their catch and send prices plummeting. â€œEven though it is safe, it could still harm sales of Fukushima seafood and lower prices, which is what happened 12 years ago,â€? conceded Junichi Matsumoto, Tepcoâ€™s chief officer for the management of treated water. â€œWe know fishing communities are worried â€¦ thatâ€™s why we and the government are working on addressing the potential reputational damage.â€? The Fukushima prefectural government says that, post-disaster, its food safety standards are among the strictest in the world. The government-set upper limit for radioactive caesium in ordinary foodstuffs such as meat and vegetables is 100 becquerels a kilogram, compared with 1,250Bq/kg in the EU and 1,200Bq/kg in the US. While officials attempt to reassure the public and other countries that Fukushima produce is safe for consumers, Tepco and the government have embarked on a PR offensive, holding regular briefings on the water discharge for Tokyo-based diplomats and journalists, and running ads on TV, in newspapers and online. â€œWe take other countriesâ€™ concerns seriously, which is why we are using every possible opportunity to explain the discharge plan to them,â€? said Ayako Ogino, a foreign ministry official. â€œWe have made a commitment to discharge the water without harming the environment or human health. To describe the water as contaminated is erroneous, as it implies that it will harm the environment.â€? The campaign has had mixed results. South Korea and China have voiced opposition to the discharge, while the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) said recently it had â€œgrave concernsâ€?. Environmental groups have challenged the Japanese governmentâ€™s claims that the water will not affect marine life or human health, while the US National Association of Marine Laboratories has pointed to a lack of adequate and accurate scientific data to support its reassurances on safety. The water release plan received a boost this month, however, when Micronesia, a member of the PIF, dropped its opposition to the water discharge. Its president, David Panuelo, said in Tokyo that his country was â€œno longer fearful or concerned about this issue now as we trust in Japanâ€™s intention and technological capabilities in not harming our shared oceanic interestsâ€?.

After a botched attempt to reach out across the political spectrum by teaming up with Owen Paterson, a Tory former environment secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/30/ecomodernism-launch-was-a-screw-up-of-impressive-proportions\">Lynas admitted</a> attempts to launch the movement in the UK had amounted to a â€œscrew-up of impressive proportionsâ€?.</p> <p>Now he is playing a key role in trying to revive ecomodernism. RePlanet, Scott-Halkes explained, had been born out of a process of â€œrebranding ecomodernismâ€?, jettisoning bits of the philosophy that had â€œbecome problematicâ€?. Over the past two years, he said, they had worked together with Monbiot to embed into their approach a critique of power. Where previously ecomodernists had been seen as naively pro-capitalist and pro-technology, RePlanet believe they have faced up to the nuances and dangers of the technologies they are proposing â€“ and the dangers of progress in general.</p> <p>Like classic ecomodernists, they see themselves as â€œpro-science and evidence-basedâ€? supporters of prosperity, who embrace progress, said Scott-Halkes. But there is a new emphasis on development and, befitting its sojourn in social democratic northern Europe, a new faith in â€œthe power of the democratic state to take control of technologies, to develop technologiesâ€?.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2a4ee1053b772b283474bc84556d2e121810b2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2a4ee1053b772b283474bc84556d2e121810b2a/0_52_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joel Scott-Halkes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joel Scott-Halkes: â€˜Nuclear is the most land-efficient energy source that has ever been invented.â€™</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emilie Madi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Precision fermentation and nuclear power are emblematic of the kinds of technical fixes they call for. Precision fermentation could, they claim, allow for the entire worldâ€™s protein to be produced from an area the size of London. It is not a pipe dream: the same technology is already used to produce most of the worldâ€™s insulin and citric acid; in the US, ice-creams containing precision fermented replicas of milk proteins are already on the market. But RePlanet says the technology must be â€œopen sourcedâ€? to ensure its democratisation, with precision fermentation breweries in every town.</p> <p>â€œWeâ€™re saying with precision fermentation, in particular, we need to get in there now, because this is food, this is sustenance,â€? said Scott-Halkes. â€œIf this does come to dominate the global food system we should be advocating for democratic control of it right now. Otherwise, weâ€™re actually genuinely screwed.â€?</p> <p>Less easy to open source is atomic energy. But Replanet believe it is the only way for humanity to meet the energy needs of a rapidly developing world while decarbonising as fast as possible. â€œNuclear is the most land-efficient energy source that has ever been invented,â€? Scott-Halkes said. â€œIt is by various degrees 300 times more land efficient than wind power, 150 times more efficient than solar power, uncountably, 4,000 to 5,000 times more land efficient than biofuels. If you want space [for] rewilding, you need nuclear.â€?</p> <p>Finland is the â€œgold standardâ€? of what RePlanet hopes to achieve. Not only have ecomodernists there managed to persuade the Green party to adopt nuclear power, but in December the partyâ€™s council agreed to a dismantling of restrictions on GM. With 20 seats in Finlandâ€™s parliament, such policy decisions have force.</p> <p>In the UK they have further to go. When pronuclear campaigners appeared on protests at Cop26 in Glasgow last year they were accused of being paid shills of the industry. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/28/lab-grown-food-is-no-way-to-nourish-the-planet\">Critics of precision fermentation</a> argue it is a complicated technology prone to centralisation, when accessible, localised, resilient and above all natural food sources are needed.</p> <p>Rob Percival, head of food policy at the Soil Association, which certifies organic food in the UK, described RePlanetâ€™s Reboot Food campaign on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rob_Percival_/status/1593148679891734528\">Twitter</a> as â€œakin to the rewilding movement getting hooked on GMO-steroidsâ€?. Percival said it was important for campaign groups to push boundaries, and he agreed with the potential for precision fermentation to displace intensive animal farming.</p> <p>â€œBut they are pushing this land-sparing concept to quite an extreme conclusion,â€? he said. â€œI think itâ€™s unwise in that intensive systems have proven time and again to be liable to corporate capture, bad for the soil, heavily reliant on chemicals.â€?</p> <p>Opponents of nuclear say it is far from living up to RePlanetâ€™s promise. Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeaceâ€™s policy director, said the world needed alternative and clean sources of energy that are quick and cheap to deploy. â€œNuclear is the opposite,â€? he said.</p> <p>â€œThe new plant at Hinkley C is over a decade behind schedule and billions over budget. The next one in line, at Sizewell C, may not even start generating energy until todayâ€™s newborns turn teenagers. Crucially, we donâ€™t need new nuclear. Solar and wind technologies are a much cheaper and quicker way to cut carbon emissions, and studies show we can keep the lights on with a wholly renewable energy system. All we need is the political will to make it happen.â€?</p> <p>Even Monbiot, who has helped to craft RePlanetâ€™s updated ecomodernism, qualifies his support for the groupâ€™s ideas. He is known as an advocate for organic farming, which RePlanet has campaigned against. But he insists, nevertheless, that fresh thinking is needed to resolve the crises affecting the environment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62be43a840003fbab647adbdeaecaf4b29642ecd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62be43a840003fbab647adbdeaecaf4b29642ecd/0_164_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Monbiot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Monbiot: â€˜We canâ€™t afford to be blinded by prejudices against certain technologies.â€™</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>â€œI broadly agree that we have to assess every issue from first principles, and we canâ€™t afford to be blinded by prejudices against certain technologies,â€? Monbiot said. â€œWe have to assess them all case by case, and we might come down in slightly different places on some of those technologies, but broadly I think we are on the same page.â€?</p> <p>RePlanet are not the only advocates of high-tech solutions to green problems. Taking his cue from Marxâ€™s embracing of modernity as the grounds for revolutionary change, Matt Huber, author of Climate Change as Class War, dismisses degrowthersâ€™ vision as â€œalmost as austere as Pol Potâ€™sâ€?. Adopting a more populist tone, the leftwingers clustered around the UKâ€™s Novara Media news website have advocated for â€œfully automated luxury communismâ€?, which went on to become the title of founder Aaron Bastaniâ€™s debut book.</p> <p>Most significantly, those with the money and power to actually bring ideas into implementation also seem to back technological solutions. Vast sums have already been invested into GM, plans are afoot for direct CO<sub>2</sub> capture via huge industrial machinery and the cost-benefit analysis around geoengineering is increasingly regarded as worth the risk.</p> <p>Ecomodernism may not, yet, be the most popular idea among those who are campaigning for a solution to planetary crises created by humanity.

It is not a pipe dream: the same technology is already used to produce most of the worldâ€™s insulin and citric acid; in the US, ice-creams containing precision fermented replicas of milk proteins are already on the market. But RePlanet says the technology must be â€œopen sourcedâ€? to ensure its democratisation, with precision fermentation breweries in every town. â€œWeâ€™re saying with precision fermentation, in particular, we need to get in there now, because this is food, this is sustenance,â€? said Scott-Halkes. â€œIf this does come to dominate the global food system we should be advocating for democratic control of it right now. Otherwise, weâ€™re actually genuinely screwed.â€? Less easy to open source is atomic energy. But Replanet believe it is the only way for humanity to meet the energy needs of a rapidly developing world while decarbonising as fast as possible. â€œNuclear is the most land-efficient energy source that has ever been invented,â€? Scott-Halkes said. â€œIt is by various degrees 300 times more land efficient than wind power, 150 times more efficient than solar power, uncountably, 4,000 to 5,000 times more land efficient than biofuels. If you want space [for] rewilding, you need nuclear.â€? Finland is the â€œgold standardâ€? of what RePlanet hopes to achieve. Not only have ecomodernists there managed to persuade the Green party to adopt nuclear power, but in December the partyâ€™s council agreed to a dismantling of restrictions on GM. With 20 seats in Finlandâ€™s parliament, such policy decisions have force. In the UK they have further to go. When pronuclear campaigners appeared on protests at Cop26 in Glasgow last year they were accused of being paid shills of the industry. Critics of precision fermentation argue it is a complicated technology prone to centralisation, when accessible, localised, resilient and above all natural food sources are needed. Rob Percival, head of food policy at the Soil Association, which certifies organic food in the UK, described RePlanetâ€™s Reboot Food campaign on Twitter as â€œakin to the rewilding movement getting hooked on GMO-steroidsâ€?. Percival said it was important for campaign groups to push boundaries, and he agreed with the potential for precision fermentation to displace intensive animal farming. â€œBut they are pushing this land-sparing concept to quite an extreme conclusion,â€? he said. â€œI think itâ€™s unwise in that intensive systems have proven time and again to be liable to corporate capture, bad for the soil, heavily reliant on chemicals.â€? Opponents of nuclear say it is far from living up to RePlanetâ€™s promise. Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeaceâ€™s policy director, said the world needed alternative and clean sources of energy that are quick and cheap to deploy. â€œNuclear is the opposite,â€? he said. â€œThe new plant at Hinkley C is over a decade behind schedule and billions over budget. The next one in line, at Sizewell C, may not even start generating energy until todayâ€™s newborns turn teenagers. Crucially, we donâ€™t need new nuclear. Solar and wind technologies are a much cheaper and quicker way to cut carbon emissions, and studies show we can keep the lights on with a wholly renewable energy system. All we need is the political will to make it happen.â€? Even Monbiot, who has helped to craft RePlanetâ€™s updated ecomodernism, qualifies his support for the groupâ€™s ideas. He is known as an advocate for organic farming, which RePlanet has campaigned against. But he insists, nevertheless, that fresh thinking is needed to resolve the crises affecting the environment. â€œI broadly agree that we have to assess every issue from first principles, and we canâ€™t afford to be blinded by prejudices against certain technologies,â€? Monbiot said. â€œWe have to assess them all case by case, and we might come down in slightly different places on some of those technologies, but broadly I think we are on the same page.â€? RePlanet are not the only advocates of high-tech solutions to green problems. Taking his cue from Marxâ€™s embracing of modernity as the grounds for revolutionary change, Matt Huber, author of Climate Change as Class War, dismisses degrowthersâ€™ vision as â€œalmost as austere as Pol Potâ€™sâ€?. Adopting a more populist tone, the leftwingers clustered around the UKâ€™s Novara Media news website have advocated for â€œfully automated luxury communismâ€?, which went on to become the title of founder Aaron Bastaniâ€™s debut book. Most significantly, those with the money and power to actually bring ideas into implementation also seem to back technological solutions. Vast sums have already been invested into GM, plans are afoot for direct CO2 capture via huge industrial machinery and the cost-benefit analysis around geoengineering is increasingly regarded as worth the risk. Ecomodernism may not, yet, be the most popular idea among those who are campaigning for a solution to planetary crises created by humanity. But it increasingly looks as though it may be the one we will get.","charCount":"10670","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/damien-gayle\">Damien Gayle</a>","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jan/02/50m-fund-will-boost-uk-nuclear-fuel-projects-ministers-say","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-02T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Â£50m fund will boost UK nuclear fuel projects, ministers say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/02/50m-fund-will-boost-uk-nuclear-fuel-projects-ministers-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jan/02/50m-fund-will-boost-uk-nuclear-fuel-projects-ministers-say","fields":{"headline":"Â£50m fund will boost UK nuclear fuel projects, ministers say","standfirst":"<p>Britain seeks to convert recycled uranium, a capability not currently available outside Russia</p>","trailText":"Britain seeks to convert recycled uranium, a capability not currently available outside Russia","byline":"Julia Kollewe","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80c2ba4ae207e5307d1906a7a28ef38ac16cec0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80c2ba4ae207e5307d1906a7a28ef38ac16cec0a/404_0_3596_2158/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>A Â£50m nuclear fuel fund to bolster production in the UK and support development of alternatives to Russian supply opens for applications on Monday, the business department has announced.</p> <p>The fund forms part of a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/102-million-government-backing-for-nuclear-and-hydrogen-innovation-in-the-uk\">nuclear fuel investment package</a> of up to Â£75m, of which up to Â£13m has already been awarded to the nuclear fuel fabricators Westinghouse in Preston, helping the company develop conversion capability for reprocessed uranium and freshly mined uranium.</p> <p>Uranium conversion is an important stage in the nuclear fuel cycle.

Guardian Australia understands several others in the room found the intervention curious, because the Australian government has made no secret of the fact the nuclear-powered submarines are to be used by the Royal Australian Navy. The comment was made during a briefing held by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Wednesday at which dozens of representatives from other diplomatic missions were also present. It is believed to have been made in the context of Beijingâ€™s longstanding claims that the Aukus deal is a breach of either the letter or spirit of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). One source said a Chinese official at the briefing said words to the effect of: â€œWhat are these boats for? Sightseeing?â€? A second source confirmed a comment about â€œsightseeingâ€? had been made. It is unclear whether the comment was made sarcastically. The Chinese embassy has been contacted for a response. The Australian government declined to comment. Dfat has conducted multiple briefings sessions this week for diplomatic missions in Canberra, including specific events for south-east Asia and another for Pacific island countries. The Chinese ambassador, Xiao Qian, was not in attendance at Wednesdayâ€™s briefing but this was not unusual because most countries were represented at a lower level than their heads of mission. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâ€™s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Chinaâ€™s participation in the briefing is a point of interest given the strength of Beijingâ€™s reaction to the Aukus submarine plans from the moment they were unveiled by the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, the US president, Joe Biden, and the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in San Diego on Tuesday morning. Australia, the US and the UK argue the NPT regime expressly allows for the transfer of naval nuclear propulsion technology, although they acknowledge this is the first time such a transfer has been made from a nuclear weapons state to a non-nuclear weapons country. The Aukus partners say they are committed to negotiating a rigorous verification and safeguards package with the International Atomic Energy Agency to set the strongest possible precedent. China, however, has argued such transfers should only be for peaceful uses. China â€“ a nuclear weapons state â€“ has put nuclear non-proliferation concerns at the centre of its international campaign against Aukus, knowing that these issues have resonance in south-east Asia and the Pacific. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said this week that the Aukus countries were trying to â€œcoerce the IAEA secretariat into making safeguards exemption arrangements, which would seriously undermine the authority of the bodyâ€?. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, rejected that argument on Thursday. â€œI do not accept those assertions,â€? Wong said during a press conference in Adelaide. â€œAustralia has an impeccable record when it comes to nuclear non-proliferation, an impeccable record, and we intend to maintain that.â€? Asked whether the Aukus deal would only further strain ties between Canberra and Beijing, Wong said the announcement had been â€œa long time comingâ€? and the region was â€œvery well aware of itâ€?. Wong said Australiaâ€™s intention was â€œto help keep the peace, to help keep stabilityâ€?. â€œAustralia doesnâ€™t seek to dominate the region, Australia seeks to ensure we contribute to a region that is stable, peaceful, secure, prosperous and in which sovereignty is respected,â€? she said. The Dfat briefings were intended to reassure countries across the region â€“ and farther afield â€“ about Australiaâ€™s intentions. It comes as Australia seeks to begin formal negotiations with the global nuclear watchdog on a safeguards arrangement. Australia has sought negotiations under an existing deal it has with the IAEA, known as the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, has explained that article 14 of that agreement allows Australia to use material for â€œa nuclear activity, such as nuclear propulsion for submarines, provided that Australia makes an arrangement with the agency in this regardâ€?. The Australian government is believed to disagree with this provision being characterised as a â€œloopholeâ€? and has promised not to enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel as part of the nuclear-powered submarine program. Grossi said that in negotiations with Australia, the IAEA would be â€œvery demandingâ€? and would insist that its inspectors be allowed to check the amount of nuclear fuel in the sealed units before and after the submarines put out to sea. Grossi told reporters that some countries had â€œstrong feelingâ€? about Aukus but added: â€œNobody coerces me. Nobody coerces the IAEA.â€? Albanese said on Thursday his government would continue to invest in diplomacy, as he rejected heavy criticism by the former Labor prime minister Paul Keating about the Aukus deal. â€œThe relationship with China is improving and that is a good thing,â€? Albanese said. The prime minister met members of the Chinese-Australian community at an event in the Victorian seat of Aston, where a by-election is due to be held on 1 April. He said: â€œWeâ€™re sending a message to this community that we represent as a government every community, regardless of where you are from, [and] that we understand that Australiaâ€™s diversity is a strength.â€?","charCount":"5555","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/daniel-hurst\">Daniel Hurst</a> Foreign affairs and defence correspondent","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/15/australia-seeks-talks-with-global-nuclear-watchdog-to-allay-aukus-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T07:27:14Z","webTitle":"Australia seeks talks with global nuclear watchdog to allay Aukus fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/15/australia-seeks-talks-with-global-nuclear-watchdog-to-allay-aukus-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/15/australia-seeks-talks-with-global-nuclear-watchdog-to-allay-aukus-fears","fields":{"headline":"Australia seeks talks with global nuclear watchdog to allay Aukus fears","standfirst":"<p>Government has promised not to enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel as part of the nuclear-powered submarine program</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/15/australia-live-news-aukus-submarines-nuclear-economy-health-weather-housing-interest-rates-nsw-vic-qld\">Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates</a></li><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_sfl\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Government has promised not to enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel as part of the nuclear-powered submarine program","byline":"Daniel Hurst Foreign affairs and defence correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3d4d81e7e4abb035e394a965e1d6c3050281656\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3d4d81e7e4abb035e394a965e1d6c3050281656/0_174_4200_2521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US nuclear submarine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US nuclear submarine: Aukus will be the first time a provision in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty regime has been used to transfer naval nuclear propulsion technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The Albanese government has requested formal talks with the global nuclear watchdog to allay any concerns Aukus could lead to undeclared nuclear activities in Australia or the diversion of enriched uranium.</p> <p>The government has also invited senior officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit Australia this year, attempting to head off a fresh campaign from China, which urged the body not to fall for â€œhigh-sounding rhetoricâ€?.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/14/what-is-the-aukus-submarine-deal-and-what-does-it-mean-the-key-facts\">What is the Aukus submarine deal and what does it mean? â€“ the key facts </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Aukus submarine arrangement is novel because it will be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/13/aukus-australian-submarine-nuclear-loophole-proliferation-fears\">first time a provision of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> regime has been used to transfer naval nuclear propulsion technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state.</p> <p>Some analysts are concerned about the precedent this may set for other countries to follow.

The coalition, led by the Australian laser fusion company HB11 Energy, also includes the University of Adelaide, the Institute of Laser Engineering at Osaka University, the Japanese laser fusion firm EX-Fusion, and the French engineering multinational Thales Group. It aims to develop an ultra-high intensity laser facility in Australia, with petawatt (one quadrillion, or one million billion watts) lasers. Dr Warren McKenzie, founder and managing director of HB11 Energy, said Australia was one of few developed countries without such a facility, adding that high-powered lasers could be used for energy generation through nuclear fusion. â€œThe same lasers can be used, for instance, for the transmutation of fission radioactive waste â€“ essentially reducing the half-life of radioactive waste from hundreds or thousands of years to tens of years,â€? he said. McKenzie also described the reported US fusion result as arguably â€œone of the biggest developments in energy science this centuryâ€?. National Ignition Facility researchers have reportedly produced more energy from a nuclear fusion reaction than what was put in â€“ a milestone known as net energy gain. In a development yet to be confirmed by the NIF, scientists are reported to have shot high-power lasers at a fuel pellet of deuterium and tritium â€“ both isotopes of hydrogen â€“ inside a metal capsule. â€œLasers both heat the fuel â€¦ but they also compress it to much higher than its natural density, and the combination of the increase in density from the compression and the heat is what triggers fusion,â€? McKenzie said. Prof Ken Baldwin of the Australian National University described the NIFâ€™s apparent advancement as â€œa truly groundbreaking achievementâ€?, but said it was unlikely fusion power would â€œsave us from climate changeâ€?. â€œAll the heavy lifting for the energy transition will be done by renewable energy and nuclear fission (existing nuclear power) â€“ with nuclear fusion at commercial scale unlikely to be available until later this century, well after the 2050 deadline needed to keep global warming below two degrees. But beyond that, fusion might provide limitless energy for centuries to come,â€? Baldwin said in a statement. Sign up for Guardian Australiaâ€™s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Mark Diesendorf, an associate professor and deputy director of the Institute of Environmental Studies at the University of New South Wales, agreed that fusion was â€œdecades away from any possibility of commercial electricity generationâ€?. â€œThereâ€™s a huge gap between this experiment â€“ which I really would hesitate to call a breakthrough â€“ and what has to be done to get commercial electricity out,â€? he said. â€œThereâ€™s an intense pulse of laser radiation for a tiny fraction of a second. Then the question is: during that tiny fraction of second, did they get more fusion energy out than they put in?â€? Diesendorf said. â€œTo generate electricity, what youâ€™ve got to do is to have thousands and thousands â€¦ perhaps millions of these pulses a day successfully getting more energy out. And then youâ€™ve got to capture that energy.â€? Diesendorf also warned of the risk of nuclear proliferation, pointing out that the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the fusion breakthrough was made, is a nuclear weapons research facility. â€œFusion produces neutrons and neutrons can be used to transmute elements â€“ so you can get nuclear explosives such as plutonium-239 and uranium-233 and uranium-235,â€? Diesendorf said. â€œYou can also produce lots of tritium â€¦ an essential component of nuclear bombs in missiles.â€? McKenzie said HB11 was the first modern private fusion company to demonstrate fusion involving lasers, and that unlike the NIF, it was not using tritium as fuel, but boron. â€œWhen we produce fusion, it doesnâ€™t create any radiation or radioactive waste,â€? he said. HB11 is still â€œfour orders of magnitudeâ€? away from achieving net energy gain. McKenzie said the firm was able to generate 0.01% of the energy input in its fusion reactions.","charCount":"4428","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/donna-lu\">Donna Lu</a>","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-everything-you-need-to-know","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T19:15:02Z","webTitle":"Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant: everything you need to know","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-everything-you-need-to-know","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-everything-you-need-to-know","fields":{"headline":"Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant: everything you need to know","standfirst":"<p>Russian forces in Ukraine have been shelling the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the largest nuclear plant of its kind in Europe</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/04/ukraine-news-russia-war-vladimir-putin-zelenskiy-kyiv-latest-live-updates-russian-invasion-nuclear-power-plant\">Russia-Ukraine war: live news</a></strong></li></ul>","trailText":"Russian forces in Ukraine have been shelling the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the largest nuclear plant of its kind in Europe","byline":"Calla Wahlquist and Donna Lu","main":"<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"98165763-046a-460f-8dd2-45e6905e34f0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u9qSK90s-B0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>","body":"<h2>What is the significance of this power plant?</h2> \n<p>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, built between 1984 and 1995,<strong> </strong>is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and the ninth largest in the world.

A statement from the newspaper industry body News Media Association said: â€œGiven the historic significance of the occasion, all efforts should have been made by the BBC to ensure that the footage, which is created using licence fee-payer money, is distributed as widely as possible to allow UK citizens to witness this event, and the BBC has not fulfilled this obligation. â€œThe decision to charge UK media companies an excessive commercial fee (with no visibility of true costs) seems perverse when the BBC is allowing foreign publishers and broadcasters the same footage for free.â€?","charCount":"5556","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/jim-waterson\">Jim Waterson</a> Media editor","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/19/spectre-of-maralinga-hangs-over-aukus-nuclear-waste-for-indigenous-communities","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-18T19:00:19Z","webTitle":"Spectre of Maralinga hangs over Aukus nuclear waste for Indigenous communities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/19/spectre-of-maralinga-hangs-over-aukus-nuclear-waste-for-indigenous-communities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/19/spectre-of-maralinga-hangs-over-aukus-nuclear-waste-for-indigenous-communities","fields":{"headline":"Spectre of Maralinga hangs over Aukus nuclear waste for Indigenous communities","standfirst":"<p>The question of where to store waste from submarines is exacerbating trauma caused by British atomic testing in South Australia in the 50s and 60s</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/19/australia-news-live-nsw-victoria-heatwave-aukus-richard-marles-election-dominic-perrottet\">Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates</a></li><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_sfl\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul>","trailText":"The question of where to store waste from submarines is exacerbating trauma caused by British atomic testing in South Australia in the 50s and 60s","byline":"Sarah Collard and Donna Lu","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3be3dcd8a6853c45bb44a80af62505944900029\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3be3dcd8a6853c45bb44a80af62505944900029/397_833_4686_2812/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barngarla traditional owners protest against a nuclear waste dump at Kimba\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barngarla traditional owners protest against a nuclear waste dump at Kimba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Turner/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Behind all the pomp of the Aukus submarine deal in San Diego there was a detail that could prove a much bigger obstacle than even the massive USS Missouri moored near the three leaders.

But now the cosiest of knitwear items has been given a makeover. Fashion-friendly brands such as The Elder Statesman, Ami Paris and Studio Nicholson are pushing the cardigan. Marks &amp; Spencer reports that sales of cardigans are performing well for spring â€“ up 90% on 2022, possibly due to the â€œinbetweenâ€? weather. A green â€œpreppyâ€? style is particularly popular. More styles will be launched by the retailer this autumn. If the quarter-zip jumper is a masculine status symbol worn by the likes of David Beckham, the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and those working in the City, the cardigan is increasingly about soft power. The Netflix series Beef provides a study in the soft power cardigan â€“ thanks to the character George Nakai, played by Joseph Lee. If, early in the series, he appears to be a kind and gentle soul, he flexes his power as the plot unravels. The cardigans he wears â€“ ostensibly the ultimate in non-threatening knitwear â€“ allow him to hide in plain sight. They have gained a cult following in fashion. A recent GQ article with the headline â€œGeorge from Beef is terrible but his cardigans are notâ€? praised choices from brands including Needles, Dries van Noten and John Elliott. Leeâ€™s Nakai isnâ€™t the only example of the soft power cardigan on TV. In the latest episode of Succession, Roman Roy wears a cardigan to look unthreatening on a business trip to Norway, when he is anything but. Away from TV, celebrities have been adopting the cardigan including Brad Pitt and the Creed star Michael B Jordan. Crucially, these are not the quiet luxury takes on the item as worn by the Roys and their ilk. Pitt wore a multicoloured zipped-up cardigan that had a folksy feel, while Jordan recently favoured a pink V-neck style with a low-cut vest. Pedro Pascal â€“ star of the Last of Us and the internetâ€™s current crush â€“ has anointed the soft power cardigan. He wore a cropped version on the red carpet, and an oversized flecked one for an appearance on Radio 1. It slots into his appeal perfectly, as described by The Face magazine: â€œ[heâ€™s] relatable, despite the fact [heâ€™s] been launched into celeb super-stardom with the force of dynamiteâ€?. Gary Armstrong, the stylist and editor of CircleZeroEight, has long worn cardigans. He has noticed the take-up of the item recently and says it fits into the kind of statement young men want to make with their clothes now. â€œIt is quite similar to the guys who have started to adopt pearl necklaces. Itâ€™s like, â€˜Iâ€™m so in touch with my own masculinity that Iâ€™m not threatened in wearing like a floral cardigan.â€™â€? Thom Scherdel, the buying manager for mens ready-to-wear at Browns, has noticed more cardigans from more trend-led designers. â€œWith multi-generational appeal, cardigans have always been a smarter alternative to casual knitwear,â€? he says. â€œHowever, recently, weâ€™ve seen the style adapted by brands that have more directional style aesthetic and who have reimagined the classic shape.â€?

Rafael Grossi also said that Iran should not have carried out recent unilateral changes at the Fordow nuclear plant, which will require increased inspections. The modifications, discovered by the IAEA and reported to the board of governors last month, involved an undeclared change to the interconnection between two machines enriching advanced uranium. Speaking at Chatham House in London, he said: â€œThere has been a modification that should have been reported. You cannot go back and right this wrong. The thing is that, of course, with this modification, the facility has new capabilities so we have to inspect more.â€? His remarks suggest Grossi was not convinced by the Iranian explanation that the changes at the plant had been due to a human error and had been corrected. But he insisted he wanted a reset with Iran. He said recent denials of access for his inspectors by the Iranians meant â€œit will be very difficult to restore a complete picture of what we have in the Islamic Republic in terms of nuclear infrastructureâ€?. Admitting he did not know if the 2015 nuclear deal with western powers could ever be revived, he said â€œ[Iranian authorities] gradually started to shut down the visibility of the agency on a number of things, which are very, very important.

The Tokyo high court on Wednesday cleared Tsunehisa Katsumata, the former chairman of Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), along with former vice-presidents Ichiro Takekuro and Sakae Muto, of professional negligence resulting in death. The court said the defendants could not have predicted the massive tsunami that crippled the power plant and triggered the worldâ€™s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl in 1986. The three men were indicted in 2016 for allegedly failing to take measures to defend the plant against tsunamis, resulting in the deaths of 44 people, including elderly patients at a hospital, who had to be evacuated after the disaster. The Fukushima Daiichi plant, on Japanâ€™s north-eastern coast, was hit by a massive tsunami caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the strongest in Japanâ€™s recorded history. More than 18,000 people died in the tsunami, but no one was recorded as having been directly killed by the nuclear meltdowns, which caused massive radiation leaks and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people living nearby â€“ some of whom have only recently been given permission to return to their homes. Wednesdayâ€™s ruling affirmed a similar verdict delivered by the Tokyo district court in September 2019. The trial focused on whether the former executives should have foreseen the massive tsunami and taken extra precautions, such as constructing a bigger seawall, to prevent a catastrophe. A government evaluation of earthquake risks published in 2002 estimated that tsunami waves of up to 15.7 metres (51ft) in height could strike Fukushima Daiichi. The findings were passed on to Tepco in 2008 â€“ three years before the disaster when a 14-metre wave struck, the Kyodo news agency said. Tepco has argued it was powerless to take precautions against a tsunami of the size that struck the plant almost 12 years ago, and that it had done everything possible to protect it. The original district court ruling, however, cast doubt on the credibility of the governmentâ€™s evaluation, saying the defendants â€œcould not have logically predicted tsunami waves over 10 metres in heightâ€?, Kyodo reported. Although they have twice been acquitted in the only criminal case against Tepco executives arising from the disaster, a separate verdict in July in a civil case against the same three men and Tepcoâ€™s former president, Masataka Shimizu, ordered them to pay Â¥13.32tn (Â£80bn at the time) for failing to prevent the disaster. In contrast to Wednesdayâ€™s decision, the court said the governmentâ€™s assessment had been reliable enough to oblige Tepco to take preventive measures. While that ruling â€“ the first to find Tepco executives liable for damage resulting from the disaster â€“ carries symbolic significance, lawyers have said the defendants do not have the means to pay the sum, believed to be the largest ever awarded in a civil lawsuit in Japan. Media reports said they would be expected to pay as much as their assets allowed.","charCount":"3216","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/justinmccurry\">Justin McCurry</a> in Tokyo","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/20/pm-to-chair-roundtable-on-boosting-uks-nuclear-power-output","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-20T22:30:08Z","webTitle":"PM to chair roundtable on boosting UKâ€™s nuclear power output","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/20/pm-to-chair-roundtable-on-boosting-uks-nuclear-power-output","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/20/pm-to-chair-roundtable-on-boosting-uks-nuclear-power-output","fields":{"headline":"PM to chair roundtable on boosting UKâ€™s nuclear power output","standfirst":"<p>Meeting comes as Boris Johnson prepares to publish his energy security strategy amid soaring prices and Ukraine war</p>","trailText":"Meeting comes as Boris Johnson prepares to publish his energy security strategy amid soaring prices and Ukraine war","byline":"Joanna Partridge","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff48ebe822b18ac80e11b2a55c3abb518da25715\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff48ebe822b18ac80e11b2a55c3abb518da25715/0_93_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Construction at Hinkley Point\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Construction work at Nuclear Island 1, at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant near Bridgwater in Somerset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Boris Johnson will chair a meeting on how to increase the UKâ€™s nuclear power output on Monday, as he prepares to publish his energy security strategy this month amid soaring prices.</p> <p>The prime minister will discuss domestic nuclear projects with leaders from the nuclear industry at a roundtable meeting at Downing Street, No 10 said.</p> <p>Johnson is expected to publish the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/19/a-guide-to-the-uk-energy-security-strategy-cost-of-living-crisis\">governmentâ€™s energy security strategy</a> later in March, against a backdrop of rocketing energy bills, which were already creating a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/gordon-brown-urges-sunak-to-address-cost-of-living-crisis-in-spring-statement\">cost of living crisis</a> even before Moscowâ€™s invasion of Ukraine led ministers to pledge to phase out Russian energy.</p> <p>The UK generated less than half (43%) of its electricity from renewable sources in 2020, and gas-fired power plants still play a significant role, with Britain reliant on gas for heating as well as electricity. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nuclearpower\">Nuclear power</a> plants currently provide about a sixth of the UKâ€™s electricity.</p> <p>Johnson has previously announced that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/04/uk-electricity-generation-boris-johnson-conservative-conference-gas\">intends to remove fossil fuels</a> from UK electricity generation by 2035, and has also argued that the country should invest in more domestic nuclear and renewable energy in order to become more self-sufficient.</p> <p>No 10 officials said topics expected to be discussed at the roundtable meeting include how government and industry can work together to remove barriers and progress future nuclear projects in the UK more quickly and cheaply.

Johnson is expected to publish the governmentâ€™s energy security strategy later in March, against a backdrop of rocketing energy bills, which were already creating a cost of living crisis even before Moscowâ€™s invasion of Ukraine led ministers to pledge to phase out Russian energy. The UK generated less than half (43%) of its electricity from renewable sources in 2020, and gas-fired power plants still play a significant role, with Britain reliant on gas for heating as well as electricity. Nuclear power plants currently provide about a sixth of the UKâ€™s electricity.

But it has been rebranded, apparently. The event, taking place in Aberdeen on 30 March, will no longer share a name with the California pop-punk band; ministers are understood to have plumped for the less lyrical â€œenergy security dayâ€?. But climate campaigners fear it looks set to be, to quote Green Dayâ€™s 2004 hit, a Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Energy secretary Grant Shapps and chancellor Jeremy Hunt have come under pressure from industry to produce a meaningful response to US president Joe Bidenâ€™s $369bn in climate subsidies, granted through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has seen major companies reallocate investment to the US. The pair will also be hoping to seize the initiative from Labour, which has made the switch to green energy a key battleground. Shapps and his newly formed Department for Energy and Net Zero certainly have a mandate to shake up a crucial industry. As the energy crisis has escalated over the past 18 months, it has exposed flaws across the sector â€“ from tariffs and decarbonisation concerns to the link between wholesale gas and electricity prices. But the Guardian has revealed that the presentation will contain measures to please the fossil fuel industry, from new offshore drilling plans to a refusal to force oil and gas companies to stop flaring by 2025 â€“ as recommended by Chris Skidmore in his net zero review. It may even give a licence to the huge, and so far undeveloped, Rosebank oil and gas field off Shetland. It is understood that Ofgem will not, as had been mooted, be given powers to include the net zero target in its regulation of the energy sector, and that the only measure aimed at improving Britainâ€™s energy efficiency will be a consultation on improving insulation in the private rental sector. On the renewables side, there are concerns Britainâ€™s prowess in offshore wind could be rapidly eroded if Bidenâ€™s IRA subsidy tempts investment away from the UK to the US. A windfall tax on some electricity generators has not helped investor confidence. Meanwhile, green campaigners hope Shapps will confirm a lifting of the effective ban on onshore wind developments, amid concerns it will persist. Industries expected to get particular attention in the presentation are nuclear, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Hunt made great fanfare of nuclear at this monthâ€™s budget, aiming to reclassify the technology as â€œsustainableâ€? so as to attract environment-conscious investors, and kicking off a competition for small modular reactor (SMR) designs. However, it is unclear whether the reclassification will help in the hunt for co-investors alongside EDF and government in the Sizewell C project in Suffolk. And industry insiders say the SMR competition has merely delayed the decision on which projects to fund. The chancellor also announced Â£20bn of spending on carbon capture and storage projects over 20 years, with a promise to get â€œspades in the groundâ€? from next year. The technology captures the CO2 emitted by big polluters and stores it underground. Backers of the projects hope Thursday will provide answers on which proposals will receive approval. Last week, power station owner Drax said it had paused investment in carbon capture until the government decides whether it will offer financial support. Huntâ€™s Â£20bn has been labelled a PR exercise and a â€œdangerous gambleâ€? on unproven technology, as the Â£1bn-a-year spending primarily falls outside this parliament. Onlookers also hope to see firmer plans on supporting the green hydrogen industry â€“ seen as important to decarbonising heavy industry â€“ electric batteries and storage facilities, vehicles and the supply of critical minerals into that sector. Shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband is not getting his hopes up. He criticised the Conservativesâ€™ â€œlow ambition and chronic underfunding of green projectsâ€?, and added that Labour plans to create a â€œpublicly owned national champion in clean power generation, and deliver a million good green jobsâ€?. Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UKâ€™s head of politics, said: â€œThis is the best opportunity for the government to stop us being left behind in the global race on green growth â€¦ [it] must put the budding UK industries of renewable energy, electric vehicles, batteries and green steel at the heart of the UKâ€™s economic plan.â€?","charCount":"4442","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/alex-lawson\">Alex Lawson</a> Energy correspondent","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/04/iran-pledges-to-restore-monitoring-equipment-at-nuclear-sites-says-iaea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-04T22:33:33Z","webTitle":"Iran pledges to restore monitoring equipment at nuclear sites, says IAEA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/04/iran-pledges-to-restore-monitoring-equipment-at-nuclear-sites-says-iaea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/04/iran-pledges-to-restore-monitoring-equipment-at-nuclear-sites-says-iaea","fields":{"headline":"Iran pledges to restore monitoring equipment at nuclear sites, says IAEA","standfirst":"<p>Restoration of cameras among assurances reportedly given to UN nuclear agency</p>","trailText":"Restoration of cameras among assurances reportedly given to UN nuclear agency","byline":"David Connett and Associated Press","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6efc5eabd5d3a545f1ddd1ec2c14d6951ad5935\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6efc5eabd5d3a545f1ddd1ec2c14d6951ad5935/0_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafael Grossi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">IAEA director general Rafael Grossi said the monitoring activities that were not operating would be restored.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atomic Energy Organization Of Ir/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Iran has pledged to restore cameras and other monitoring equipment at its nuclear sites and to allow more inspections at a facility where particles of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade were recently detected, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday.</p> <p>Restoration of the cameras is among assurances reportedly given to the UN nuclear agency that Tehran will finally assist an investigation into uranium particles found at undeclared sites, it said.</p> <p>The breakthrough came as the watchdogâ€™s director general, Rafael Grossi, who earlier met the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, in Tehran, returned to Vienna and said that some of the monitoring activities that were not operating would be restored. </p> <p>A joint statement from the IAEA and Iran said: â€œIran expressed its readiness to â€¦ provide further information and access to address the outstanding safeguards issues.â€?</p> <p>The statement did not go into detail on the extent of the assurances but the possibility of improved relations between the UN body and Iran is likely to ward off fresh calls from western countries for Iran to cooperate, diplomats said.</p> <p>Iran has made similar promises before that have yielded little or nothing.

So I welcome his visit here today â€“ itâ€™s good to see the president coming and we hope to see investment into Northern Ireland flowing from his efforts and those of his special envoy.â€? Speaking at Ulster University in Belfast, Biden â€“ citing the cyber and tech industries, green energy and young entrepreneurs â€“ said the opportunities for Northern Ireland to lift itself into becoming a major part of the UK economy were â€œincredibleâ€?. He urged political leaders to â€œsustain the peaceâ€?, promising it would â€œunleash this incredible economic opportunityâ€?. Bidenâ€™s special economic envoy for Northern Ireland, Joe Kennedy III, would be heading a trade delegation to the region â€œmaybe later this yearâ€? to â€œsuperchargeâ€? a new wave of investment, Biden promised. He urged the DUP to return to power-sharing arrangements at Stormont and said an â€œeffective devolved government â€¦ is going to draw even greater opportunity in this regionâ€?. Kennedy later told reporters that US corporations always sought stability as a prerequisite for investment. Biden said: â€œI hope the assembly and the executive will soon be restored.â€? Cautious not to be seen as interfering, he quickly added: â€œThat is a judgment for you to make, not me, but I hope it happens.â€? He told the audience that he was part-English by birth but he swerved commentary over any alleged pro-nationalist bias. Donaldson was seen beaming while having convivial chats with Kennedy and later on an informal walkabout with Biden. He said restoration of power sharing would only happen if the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, took steps to remove the remaining Brexit barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Sunak missed Bidenâ€™s speech in order to visit a senior PSNI officer who was shot in Northern Ireland earlier this year. Sunak is understood to have met DCI John Caldwell and his family at a hospital in the north-west. The PSNI described it as a â€œprivate visitâ€? and would not comment.

The atmosphere at Ulster University was reverent and jovial, with the president working the room and posing for selfies and handshakes with party leaders after his speech. Doug Beattie, the head of the Ulster Unionist party, and Colum Eastwood, the leader of the SDLP, said Biden had spoken to them about the economic opportunities in their private conversations, underlining the message from the US. Time was also set aside for the Northern Irish actor James Martin, who became the first person with Downâ€™s syndrome to have the leading role in an Oscar-winning movie, after starring in the short film An Irish Goodbye.","charCount":"5079","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lisaocarroll\">Lisa O'Carroll</a> in Belfast","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/jan/24/acosta-danza-spectrum-review-linbury-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-24T11:32:08Z","webTitle":"Acosta Danza: Spectrum review â€“ passion and power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/24/acosta-danza-spectrum-review-linbury-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/jan/24/acosta-danza-spectrum-review-linbury-theatre-london","fields":{"headline":"Acosta Danza: Spectrum review â€“ passion and power","standfirst":"<p><strong>Linbury theatre, London<br></strong>From hints of jazz and vaudeville to a magical Nijinsky-inspired duet, itâ€™s a pleasure to watch these dancers perform</p>","trailText":"From hints of jazz and vaudeville to a magical Nijinsky-inspired duet, itâ€™s a pleasure to watch these dancers perform","byline":"Lyndsey Winship","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a523c24fac748ce1936a8ae7cf1a8d8ab25d615\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a523c24fac748ce1936a8ae7cf1a8d8ab25d615/218_491_3548_2128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Standout performance â€¦ RaÃºl Reinoso in Portal from Spectrum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Standout performance â€¦ RaÃºl Reinoso in Portal from Spectrum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The title of this mixed bill is spot on when it comes to describing the full range of Acosta Danza.

The government cited national security concerns when it rejected a Senate order to produce documents, including those about options to manage operational waste from the nuclear-powered submarine program. The move comes just months after the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council warned against allowing a cloak of national security to â€œmask inadequate radiation safety protection of the Australian public, weaken regulatory authority, or inhibit transparency on matters of Australian public safetyâ€?. David Shoebridge, a Greens senator and defence spokesperson, said the council was â€œthe very agency entrusted to protect Australians from radiation and ensure nuclear safety and security, yet the government is already ignoring its adviceâ€?. â€œThe hiding of information at this early stage signals a deeply unsettling approach to future regulation, transparency and oversight of these nuclear submarines,â€? Shoebridge said. His motion had sought a range of documents reviewed by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) working group, including the safeguards required for a nuclear-powered submarine program. It also sought information about the â€œcharacterisation, classification and acceptance of risks in a nuclear environmentâ€? and any minutes of meetings held with the nuclear-powered submarine taskforce on these topics.

Sign up for Guardian Australiaâ€™s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup â€œIt may be prejudicial to the security or defence of the commonwealth, and could prejudice international relations as well,â€? he said. The Coalition joined with Labor to defeat the motion in the Senate this week. The former independent senator and submariner Rex Patrick said the blocking of the motion â€œshows the shallowness of thinking behind both major parties as to the need for complete transparency around this important issueâ€?. â€œThis Aukus program has been orchestrated in total secrecy such that the government and Defence could get to a point of announcing a fait accompli without any debate or resistance,â€? Patrick said. â€œThere are some things that should properly be kept secret around a submarine â€“ but these things should not include nuclear stewardship, nuclear regulation, nuclear safety or how to deal with operational waste and spent fuel.â€? Patrick has, however, used freedom of information laws to obtain some other documents from Ansto and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (Arpansa). These include minutes of an Ansto board meeting on 9 February showing the agency will seek government funding of $34.5m over the next four years because it faces increased workload â€œas a direct result of a nuclear-powered submarine programâ€?. Ansto is also concerned about the risk of a â€œloss of workforceâ€? to other taskforces and regulators as the Aukus project ramps up. It expects â€œincreased frequency of requests for radiological monitoringâ€? coinciding with an increase in visits to Australia by US and UK nuclear-powered submarines. A nuclear emergency response exercise was held in Hobart on Thursday. Guardian Australia understands this was the latest in a long series of â€œtabletopâ€? exercises that aim to ensure government agencies can support nuclear-powered warship visits. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said Australia must become â€œresponsible nuclear stewardsâ€?. â€œThis will mean developing the full suite of skills, facilities and institutions along with an appropriate regulatory and legislative architecture to be nuclear stewards,â€? he said. The government has promised to establish â€œa new dedicated executive agency responsible for delivering the optimal pathway for Australiaâ€™s nuclear-powered submarine programâ€?, while also setting up a new independent regulator. Within 12 months the government would â€œset out the processâ€? to identify current or future defence land that could be used for the storage and disposal of nuclear waste, Marles said. â€œI want to assure the parliament that there will be appropriate public consultation, particularly with First Nations communities to respect and protect cultural heritage,â€? he said. In the latest sign of misgivings within Labor, a party branch in the electorate of the prime minster, Anthony Albanese, passed a motion calling on his government to â€œwithdraw from the Aukus alliance and cease any program in pursuit of the acquisition of nuclear submarinesâ€?. Party members at the Enmore branch meeting this week agreed that Labor should prioritise spending that contributes to the â€œsocial good of our society rather than wasting hundreds of billions of dollars on a dangerous and unnecessary weapons programâ€?. According to a copy that has been widely circulated within NSW Labor, including to a large number of branch secretaries, the motion argued Aukus was â€œnot in the interests of the Australian peopleâ€? and â€œcould take us into an unnecessary and devastating warâ€?. The motion reflects concerns within elements of the partyâ€™s rank-and-file membership, but does not yet indicate a groundswell that could stop the deal. The federal Labor caucus is largely united behind the Aukus agreement unveiled last week by the prime minister, even though some MPs have asked questions. The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, vowed to allay concerns about the multi-decade plans. â€œThis is the most significant industrial endeavour this country has ever attempted,â€? Conroy said. â€œThat is why we need to give people confidence we have a plan and have thought through how to deliver it.â€? The Petersham branch â€“ also within Albaneseâ€™s electorate â€“ passed an anti-Aukus motion in late February, before the San Diego announcement. Labor members are also mobilising against the possibility of Port Kembla being selected as a future base for nuclear-powered submarines. Some members are understood to have been emboldened to register their concerns, after several prominent Labor figures including the former prime minister Paul Keating spoke out against Aukus.","charCount":"6345","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/daniel-hurst\">Daniel Hurst</a> Foreign affairs and defence correspondent","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/12/safety-of-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-hangs-in-the-balance","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-12T05:00:52Z","webTitle":"Safety of Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant hangs in the balance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/safety-of-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-hangs-in-the-balance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/12/safety-of-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-hangs-in-the-balance","fields":{"headline":"Safety of Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant hangs in the balance","standfirst":"<p>Shelling near the six-reactor facility plus a shortage of workers and uncertain backup power could be making it the most dangerous place on Earth</p>","trailText":"Shelling near the six-reactor facility plus a shortage of workers and uncertain backup power could be making it the most dangerous place on Earth","byline":"Julian Borger in Nikopol","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e592a50b987f11cba10fb8344c122dcafbbdbf65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e592a50b987f11cba10fb8344c122dcafbbdbf65/0_55_6720_4311/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant seen from Nikopol\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant seen from Nikopol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The Russian shell that struck in the night had taken away the wall of a top-floor apartment, and in its place was just freezing air blowing off the Dnieper River â€“ and a view of Europeâ€™s biggest nuclear power station on the other bank.</p> <p>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plantâ€™s silhouette â€“ with its two fat cooling towers and the row of six squat blocks â€“ has become globally familiar since it was dubbed the most dangerous place on Earth: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia\">six nuclear reactors on the frontline of a catastrophic war.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bbd6985d83c74b82f16d328f6b5912b2d7d6ae4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bbd6985d83c74b82f16d328f6b5912b2d7d6ae4/0_147_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker fixes an apartment in a building hit by a Russian missile few days ago in Nikopol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker fixes up an apartment in a building hit by a Russian missile few days ago in Nikopol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a fairly typical night last week, the Russians on the left bank of the river fired 40 shells and rockets into Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-held right bank, falling on its rows of <em>krushchevky</em>, five-storey blocks of flats built for factory workers in the 1960s and named after the Soviet leader of the time.</p> <p>After 10 months of war, the blocks are half empty, so there are fewer people to kill.

On Thursday, the Ukrainian nuclear power company, Energoatom, accused Russia of bringing Grad multiple launch rocket systems near reactor number 6, which is near the area of where spent nuclear fuel is kept. The likely aim, Energoatom alleged, was to shell Nikopol and the nearby town of Marzanets, using their position as cover.</p> <p>The walls of the reactors are thick enough to withstand artillery fire, but a direct hit on the spent fuel containers could well lead to the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plantâ€™s silhouette â€“ with its two fat cooling towers and the row of six squat blocks â€“ has become globally familiar since it was dubbed the most dangerous place on Earth: six nuclear reactors on the frontline of a catastrophic war. On a fairly typical night last week, the Russians on the left bank of the river fired 40 shells and rockets into Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-held right bank, falling on its rows of krushchevky, five-storey blocks of flats built for factory workers in the 1960s and named after the Soviet leader of the time. After 10 months of war, the blocks are half empty, so there are fewer people to kill. The only reported casualty on this particular night was a 65-year-old man who was taken to hospital, and whose flat now afforded such a comprehensive view of the power plant. By the next morning, the repairs had already begun. An electrician restored power to the rest of the building, and two men were in the remains of the apartment itself, sweeping up and putting chipboard in place of absent walls. There were four loud bangs as the Ukrainian army guns on the nearby riverbank opened fire on Russian positions and, a few minutes later, Nikopolâ€™s air sirens sounded in anticipation of a Russian response, though none was forthcoming that morning. The basements of the krushchevky have been turned into shelters with beds and school desks but most of the remaining population are so inured to bombardment, they just carry on with their day. The Ukrainians insist they are extremely careful about what they shoot at, even when they receive fire from the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant. On Thursday, the Ukrainian nuclear power company, Energoatom, accused Russia of bringing Grad multiple launch rocket systems near reactor number 6, which is near the area of where spent nuclear fuel is kept. The likely aim, Energoatom alleged, was to shell Nikopol and the nearby town of Marzanets, using their position as cover. The walls of the reactors are thick enough to withstand artillery fire, but a direct hit on the spent fuel containers could well lead to the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Since seizing control of the power station in March, the Russians have begun building a concrete shelter over the spent fuel, but Ukrainian officials say it is being done without following the normal international safety protocols. Earlier in the week, Russiaâ€™s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine of â€œnuclear terrorismâ€?, saying its armed forces had fired 33 large calibre shells at the Zaporizhzhia plant over the previous two weeks. The most recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has four inspectors at the Russian-occupied site, said last Friday there had been no shelling of the plant since 20 November, although artillery fire had landed in the vicinity. Petro Kotin, Energoatomâ€™s president, claims that the bombardments of the area around the nuclear reactors are false flag attacks carried out by Russian occupation forces. â€œThey have two special trucks, which we know have mortars inside, which go into the forest and each time they go there, there is shelling around the plant,â€? Kotin told the Guardian.

Their reliance on Sam Kerr staying fit could be a concern. But with their captain, the Matildas possess plenty of potential.</p> <h2><strong>6</strong><strong>) Spain</strong></h2> <p>Despite missing 15 key players after a falling out with the federation over conditions, Spain just keep winning. Wins against Norway and China came in this window. They could be formidable if the impasse with the players is resolved in time.</p> <h2><strong>7</strong><strong>)</strong> <strong>Canada</strong></h2> <p>How Canada will look this summer remains unanswered. A pay dispute and injuries have taken their toll. That they lost narrowly to France shows the character of the Olympic champions can not be discounted.</p> <h2><strong>8</strong><strong>) Brazil</strong></h2> <p>Brazil are without Marta, Debinha and Ludmila, but only narrowly lost to England on penalties in the Finalissima and earned a shock 2-1 defeat of Germany. A team growing in confidence with each positive result.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e406bfea1070ae0ec6fe8d818fcc656e8b64609e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e406bfea1070ae0ec6fe8d818fcc656e8b64609e/0_132_3702_2221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazilâ€™s Geyse lets fly against Germany during the recent friendly in Nuremberg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazilâ€™s Geyse lets fly against Germany during the recent friendly in Nuremberg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthias SchrÃ¤der/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>9</strong><strong>) Sweden</strong></h2> <p>Peter Gerhardssonâ€™s side are clearly not the team they once were.

Influential striker Ada Hegerberg leaving the pitch looking uncomfortable so soon after her return from injury will be a concern.</p> <h2><strong>14</strong><strong>) China</strong></h2> <p>Defeat to Spain illustrated how much China need to improve, but they are capable of shutting out an attack. England will need to be wary when they meet in Group D.</p> <h2><strong>15</strong><strong>) Italy</strong></h2> <p>Have lost their way a little since an impressive showing at their first World Cup in 10 years in 2019.

They have slumped to three draws and a defeat this year, with a 0-0 draw with China and 2-1 loss to Iceland coming in this international break.</p> <h2><strong>21</strong><strong>) Colombia</strong></h2> <p>Colombia lost to rance and Italy but the displays showed they can compete. Their form is strong and they were only beaten narrowly by Brazil in last yearâ€™s Copa AmÃ©rica final.</p> <h2><strong>22</strong><strong>) Nigeria</strong></h2> <p>Nigeria rounded off a successful international window with a comfortable victory over New Zealand. They had previously beaten Haiti 2-1. After a disappointing Africa Cup of Nations, their progress is clear.</p> <h2><strong>23</strong><strong>) New Zealand</strong></h2> <p>The co-hosts are on a dire run of form. New Zealand have not won in nine games, with losses to the USA, Portugal, Argentina and, most recently, Nigeria.</p> <h2><strong>24</strong><strong>) Jamaica</strong></h2> <p>Conceded nine and scored twice in defeats to Spain, Czech Republic and Australia at the friendly Cup of Nations in February.

In contrast, they also added the Finalissima to their ever-expanding trophy cabinet this window. The Lionesses are still favourites with time to fix any problems. 2) USA It feels wrong to knock the back-to-back world champions off the top spot. They are still a force but defeats to Spain, England and Germany at the tail end of 2022 showed there is work to do. That may already be in progress as they are unbeaten this year. 3) Germany Defeat against Brazil will have surprised many, but Germany undoubtedly remain on track. Victory over the Netherlands showed their ability. The injury Alexandra Popp picked up in Nuremberg is a worry. 4) France New-look France, with controversial manager Corinne Diacre gone and HervÃ© Renard in, seem happier. A resilient recovery against Colombia in Renardâ€™s first game was followed by a 2-1 defeat of the Olympic champions, Canada. 5) Australia Australia finished their overseas tour with optimism. Despite losing to Scotland, they then beat the European champions England. Their reliance on Sam Kerr staying fit could be a concern. But with their captain, the Matildas possess plenty of potential. 6) Spain Despite missing 15 key players after a falling out with the federation over conditions, Spain just keep winning. Wins against Norway and China came in this window. They could be formidable if the impasse with the players is resolved in time. 7) Canada How Canada will look this summer remains unanswered. A pay dispute and injuries have taken their toll. That they lost narrowly to France shows the character of the Olympic champions can not be discounted. 8) Brazil Brazil are without Marta, Debinha and Ludmila, but only narrowly lost to England on penalties in the Finalissima and earned a shock 2-1 defeat of Germany. A team growing in confidence with each positive result. 9) Sweden Peter Gerhardssonâ€™s side are clearly not the team they once were. A loss to Denmark and a dramatic six-goal draw with Norway will be seen as a setback in their preparations. 10) Denmark Back-to-back wins against top-10 nations Sweden and Japan without influential forward Pernille Harder is no mean feat and a turnaround from defeats to Australia and the Netherlands to finish 2022. 11) Japan Defeat to Denmark will have not been on the cards for the 2011 World Cup champions. That loss followed a 2-1 victory over Portugal. Struggling for consistency against the top sides. 12) Netherlands The Dutch are still trying to find the answers to life without Vivianne Miedema. A comfortable win over Poland will have built confidence, but defeat to Germany showed they might struggle against the best. 13) Norway Came from behind twice against Sweden to earn a 3-3 draw after a 4-2 defeat to Spain in this window. Influential striker Ada Hegerberg leaving the pitch looking uncomfortable so soon after her return from injury will be a concern. 14) China Defeat to Spain illustrated how much China need to improve, but they are capable of shutting out an attack. England will need to be wary when they meet in Group D. 15) Italy Have lost their way a little since an impressive showing at their first World Cup in 10 years in 2019. A 2-1 defeat of Colombia was the teamâ€™s only fixture in this window. 16) South Korea Colin Bellâ€™s side put 10 past Zambia in two matches in this window. They possess quality in attack, but struggled against stronger opposition at the Arnold Clark Cup in February. 17) Portugal A 2-1 defeat to Japan and draw with Wales rounds off the World Cup debutants international break. Before that they were unbeaten in eight months, with wins over Iceland, Haiti, Costa Rica, New Zealand and Cameroon. 18) Republic of Ireland Irelandâ€™s unbeaten run ended with two narrow defeats to the USA. The performances more than the results, however, showed that Vera Pauwâ€™s side are not to be dismissed. 19) Argentina After a heavy loss to Spain at the end of 2022, Argentina have beaten World Cup co-host New Zealand twice and earned a draw and win over Venezuela in this window. 20) Switzerland Switzerland have struggled to get their World Cup campaign going. They have slumped to three draws and a defeat this year, with a 0-0 draw with China and 2-1 loss to Iceland coming in this international break. 21) Colombia Colombia lost to rance and Italy but the displays showed they can compete. Their form is strong and they were only beaten narrowly by Brazil in last yearâ€™s Copa AmÃ©rica final. 22) Nigeria Nigeria rounded off a successful international window with a comfortable victory over New Zealand. They had previously beaten Haiti 2-1. After a disappointing Africa Cup of Nations, their progress is clear. 23) New Zealand The co-hosts are on a dire run of form. New Zealand have not won in nine games, with losses to the USA, Portugal, Argentina and, most recently, Nigeria. 24) Jamaica Conceded nine and scored twice in defeats to Spain, Czech Republic and Australia at the friendly Cup of Nations in February. The team has one win in seven games. 25) South Africa Banyana Banyana have struggled since winning a first Africa Cup of Nations title in 2022. A 3-2 defeat to Serbia concluded this window. 26) Costa Rica Costa Rica endured a tough window with a heavy defeat to Scotland and narrow loss to Poland. Two wins against the Philippines last year showed they can compete with those around them. 27) Philippines Yet to be tested against top-level opposition. They cruised to wins over Pakistan and Tajikistan in their quest for Olympic qualification. Suffered narrow defeats to Scotland and Wales in February. 28) Vietnam One of the emerging nations in Asian football. Their focus, however, has been elsewhere this window with Olympic 2024 qualifying. They beat Nepal twice to progress before their World Cup debut. 29) Morocco Another World Cup debutant, Morocco suffered back-to-back defeats to Czech Republic and Romania in this window. That was added to a draw and defeat to the Republic of Ireland in November. 30) Haiti Yet another debutant, Haiti qualified through the intercontinental playoff this year. A narrow defeat to Nigeria showed promise. They possess one of the most exciting young players in Melchie Dumornay, who will join Lyon this summer. 31) Zambia Zambia enjoyed a standout 2022, defying the odds to finish third at the Africa Cup of Nations and win the Cosafa Championship. They suffered two heavy defeats to South Korea in this window and are, as yet, untested against top opposition. 32) Panama Panama beat the Dominican Republic twice in this break.

But he said: â€œChallenges remain of how you can get the energy out of the system, how you can sustain the energy for long enough to be useful, how you scale up that energy and whether the energy can be cheap enough to compete with other sources.â€?","charCount":"5701","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/iansample\">Ian Sample</a> Science editor","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/09/discord-in-israel-threatens-benjamin-netanyahus-hold-on-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-09T20:54:20Z","webTitle":"Crises on multiple fronts threaten Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s grip on power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/09/discord-in-israel-threatens-benjamin-netanyahus-hold-on-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/09/discord-in-israel-threatens-benjamin-netanyahus-hold-on-power","fields":{"headline":"Crises on multiple fronts threaten Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s grip on power","standfirst":"<p>Support for prime minister wanes as his â€˜plot to overturn Israelâ€™s democracyâ€™ is seen as threat to national security</p>","trailText":"Support for prime minister wanes as his â€˜plot to overturn Israelâ€™s democracyâ€™ is seen as threat to national security","byline":"Bethan McKernan in Jerusalem","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cab90f8b9cd440a4a98fc1f744189772c956c6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cab90f8b9cd440a4a98fc1f744189772c956c6e/0_191_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Israelis demonstrate against Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition government's judicial overhaul in Tel Aviv.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Israelis demonstrate against Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition government's judicial overhaul in Tel Aviv.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilan Rosenberg/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>On Friday afternoon, Israelâ€™s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, found himself standing at the side of a remote road in the vast desert valley that runs the length of the occupied West Bankâ€™s frontier with Jordan.</p> <p>Along with his defence minister, Yoav Galant, Netanyahu was inspecting the scene of a shooting attack earlier in the day that killed British-Israeli sisters Maia and Rina Dee, 20 and 15, and left their 45-year-old mother Lucy fighting for her life.

It consists largely of redbrick Victorian terraces. There are similar streets throughout the area, in Walthamstow, northeast London. Some houses are pebble-dashed. Some have doors painted in contemporary grey. There are wind chimes, geraniums in boxes, wheelie bins and the occasional cat sitting on a gate post. The only unusual feature is the number of windows displaying an A4 poster with the words â€œPower Stationâ€? printed in the font used by polling stations.</p> <p>Power, in the sense of the energy, is at the forefront of everyoneâ€™s mind. Energy bills have reached record highs and are still rising, with the war in Ukraine highlighting how fragile energy supplies can be. This yearâ€™s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop27\" title=\"\">Cop27 </a>climate conference promised money to poorer countries to assist with damage caused by climate change, yet no agreement was reached on phasing out fossil fuels. The idea of cleaner power, generated closer to home, should feel like an obvious goal. But, at the moment, there are no large-scale programmes dedicated to making it happen. Instead, there are people like Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Well, if someone came and said there was a way of helping with the bills, youâ€™d be over the moon, wouldnâ€™t you?</p> <footer> <cite>Ejaz Hussain</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These two are on the roof of their house, sitting on a bed they have just assembled. It is made up with a knitted blanket, bright sheets and a cheap foam mattress that is plastic-wrapped against the elements. Facing one way you can see their narrow back garden that ends when it hits the railway embankment. Turn around and you look down into their street, Lynmouth Road, which Dan and Hilary want to turn into a solar power station. They are living on their roof as a crowdfunder for the project. â€œI think it will be fine,â€? says Hilary, who has been scanning both the sky and the weather forecast. â€œI only get scared when the children say they want to come up, then I turn to jelly.â€?</p> <p>The couple are artists and filmmakers. They live in the middle of the street, with their children, EsmÃ©, 12, and George, 10, and the familyâ€™s two dogs. â€œIt is a street that has a sense of community,â€? says Hilary, down from the roof and sitting at their kitchen table. â€œThat became apparent with the Covid mutual aid group that was set up.â€? And it was during lockdown that a sentence from economist Ann Pettiforâ€™s book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/19/case-green-new-deal-ann-pettifor-on-fire-naomi-klein-review\" title=\"\">The Case for the Green New Deal</a></em>, which makes a strong argument for total decarbonisation and a financial system based on fairness, struck both of them. The phrase was: â€œEvery building a power station.â€? â€œWe clung on to that,â€? says Hilary.</p> <p>There was also <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/52636876-people-power\" title=\"\">Peopleâ€™s Power</a></em> by American writer Ashley Dawson. â€œHe wrote about energy democracy and tackling the power monopolies within the energy industry,â€? she adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9481c603203fba909fa1748cd14713128e2451fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9481c603203fba909fa1748cd14713128e2451fc/0_388_5541_6926/800.jpg\" alt=\"â€˜Weâ€™re busy behind the scenesâ€™: Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell in bed on their roof as part of a fundraising drive.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">â€˜Weâ€™re busy behind the scenesâ€™: Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell in bed on their roof as part of a fundraising drive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Clift/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea started to take shape. Could they make a home into a power station? And not just their home, but perhaps their whole street by linking the houses together into a grid? Buying and installing a solar system for an average three-bedroom house costs around Â£10,000, they discovered. Linking them together would be hard â€“ the technology is complex, especially in an urban area with lots of individual buildings. They did more research. And then they started talking to neighbours.</p> <p>â€œWell, if someone came and said there was a way of helping with the bills, youâ€™d be over the moon, wouldnâ€™t you?â€? says Ejaz Hussain, 71, now retired. â€œIf it comes off, Iâ€™ll know that Iâ€™ve been blessed.â€?</p> <p>Sipke Visser, 45, is a photographer and retoucher. He lives with his wife, their two children and his father-in-law. â€œI know Dan and Hilary, so I wasnâ€™t that surprised,â€? he says, â€œBut I do think if a complete stranger were to knock on my door, I would be very sceptical.â€?</p> <p>â€œWe looked at putting solar panels up quite a few years ago and we found the cost of doing it was too much,â€? says Pippa Evans, 57, who works at an adoption and fostering therapeutic agency. â€œSo I was intrigued when this flyer came through the letterbox. I wanted to know how it was going to work and if we could afford it. Were Dan and Hilary going to coordinate everything? I knew about their previous project. So I knew they were quite good at making things happen.â€?</p> <p>The previous project was Bank Job. In 2018, the couple started working in an empty building, a former bank on one of Walthamstowâ€™s main streets. They printed artwork that looked like bank notes, complete with pictures of people from local community projects, and sold them, raising Â£40,000 in the process. Half the money went back to the local groups. And with the remaining Â£20,000 they bought up Â£1.2m worth of high-interest debt owed by people in the local community. â€œYou can buy it for so much less because the assumption is that it wonâ€™t be paid off,â€? says Dan. They let the debtors know there was nothing left to pay, although GDPR rules meant this could only be done by sending letters via a debt broker. Then they packed up the paper records into a gold-coloured van and blew the whole thing up on wasteland outside Canary Wharf, the towers of the UKâ€™s financial sector looming in the background. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/26/bank-job-review-print-money-cancel-debt-hilary-powell-daniel-edelstyn\" title=\"\">documentary</a> they made about the project came out in 2021 and the remains of the van are currently on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6c008da072c31ab213e8eeff7701422f49ce6f75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c008da072c31ab213e8eeff7701422f49ce6f75/0_161_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big bang: the exploding van in Docklands, part of Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powellâ€™s Bank Job artwork.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big bang: the exploding van in Docklands, part of Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powellâ€™s Bank Job artwork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Edelstyn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They describe Power Station as a natural evolution. â€œItâ€™s also a show-and-do project,â€? says Dan. â€œWeâ€™re learning as we go and weâ€™re sharing it as we learn it.â€?</p> <p>â€œWeâ€™re not setting ourselves up as experts,â€? adds Hilary. â€œThere isnâ€™t just one solution and we donâ€™t know everything about kilowatts per hour, so weâ€™re a conduit. Weâ€™re learning and educating ourselves and others and then also building partnerships with people who are experts.â€? Their own expertise, they say, is in making a project come to life and then drawing attention to the issues using art and storytelling.</p> <p>As of 2019 there were around 300 <a href=\"https://green-alliance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Community_Energy_2.0.pdf\" title=\"\">community energy</a> projects in the UK covering 67,000 homes, according to the thinktank <a href=\"https://green-alliance.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Green Alliance</a>. The sector was hit when the governmentâ€™s community energy strategy was scrapped, with at least 66 projects folding in 2017 and more becoming precarious. The initial grand design for Lynmouth Road was for an entire street interlinked, powered for free and managed by a cooperative. But the mixture of rented and private, leasehold and freehold, and various mortgages with various banks meant dropping uniform infrastructure across the rooftops would be almost impossible. â€œIt turns out that not many people fully own their roof,â€? says Dan.</p> <p>While the whole street canâ€™t be linked now, Dan harbours a dream of making this happen as the project grows and would love to see a community battery so that those who canâ€™t have solar panels could also access power. And with 30 households involved â€“ nearly half the residencies in Lynmouth Road â€“ there is enough for the street to become a solar energy hotspot and model for what other streets could also achieve in terms of renewable power.</p> <p>The project, as it stands, will be funded in various ways. There are grants from organisations, such as the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-and-strategies/environment-and-climate-change/energy/london-community-energy-fund\" title=\"\">London Community Energy Fund</a>. Thereâ€™s the crowdfunder, running while Dan and Hilary sleep on top of their house. They have also printed a new run of bank notes to sell, the notes and large handprinting machines currently occupying half of their living room. Buying solar equipment in bulk brings the price down, so participating residents can offer to pay, but the scheme is free for those who need it to be. Each resident will be given a grant for their solar installation and deal with the company directly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ba6fa77710dc5d98c9e0294b6c2e7fbd100a468e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba6fa77710dc5d98c9e0294b6c2e7fbd100a468e/0_316_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the money: local kids help to print artwork bank notes, watched over by Hilary Powell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the money: local kids help to print artwork bank notes, watched over by Hilary Powell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Edelstyn and HIlary Powell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we sit on the bed on the roof, the surveyor from the solar company is finishing his assessments. He climbs the scaffolding at the back of the house to come and chat, although he doesnâ€™t make it all the way up. â€œItâ€™s a bit ironic, in my line of work, but Iâ€™m not great with heights,â€? he says.</p> <p>Not everyone in the street has wanted or been able to take part. â€œSome people just shut the door before we started speaking,â€? says Dan. â€œThen there were people who were dying or divorcing or moving. Or having a loft conversion.â€? Loft conversions came up a lot. They can make rooftops unsuitable for solar panels, but the more frequent issue was that of imminent building work.</p> <p>Andy Richford, 70, is one of the people planning a loft conversion. An editorial consultant working in scientific publishing and with a background in ecology, he believes the project will amplify a necessary message. â€œIâ€™ve been banging on about it for years,â€? he says. â€œI might not be able to participate in terms of getting the panels, but making a difference is important to me. Putting solar panels on top of houses, with a direct feed into the house, means energy isnâ€™t lost in transmission and we donâ€™t have the worry of covering acres and acres of farmland or wild land.â€?</p> <p><em><strong>The ground on which</strong></em> Lynmouth Road stands was once part of the marshland on the banks of the River Lea. The remaining marsh is less than half a mile away, some of it a Site of Special Scientific Interest and all of it popular with picnickers, dog walkers, runners and the occasional raver. The Lynmouth Road area, says Hilary, who has been looking into its history, was a watercress farm until the houses started going up in 1886. The Victorian era was Walthamstowâ€™s first growth spurt. Boosted by new rail links, the land filled up with houses for workers. It remained a largely working-class area for most of the 20th century, but in the 2000s house prices accelerated andWalthamstow, with its garden terraces, good schools and decent transport links, became a prime location. Between 2012 and 2019, house prices more than doubled.</p> <p>â€œIt used to be full of very long-term residents,â€? says Hilary. â€œOne family staying in a house for decades. We moved in around 14 years ago and found a newspaper from 1945.â€? Dan also mentions a former resident, Dorothy Burroughs, who spent her 100 years living on the street, only leaving to briefly enter a care home before her death last year. Dorothy remembered when electricity first came to the houses in the 1930s. â€œShe said that people needed to be shown what to do and how to use appliances. People would come round and demonstrate.â€?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"958ba6738a11140abf9f8bcec5a00a932bc5f9c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/958ba6738a11140abf9f8bcec5a00a932bc5f9c7/0_76_2835_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Show stoppers: Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell with their Bank Job art at the Fitzwilliam, Cambridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Show stoppers: Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell with their Bank Job art at the Fitzwilliam, Cambridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Edelstyn and HIlary Powell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ejaz Hussain has lived here since 1978. He has worked all of his adult life, including 20 years at a local food processing factory, now demolished to make way for flats. â€œIâ€™m struggling, although the mortgage is paid. Iâ€™ve got two daughters, one at college, one about to go to university. We put them first. But the bills come in and the house needs repairs and Iâ€™m on my pension,â€? he says. Like many of his neighbours, he had also looked at solar panels, but had been unable to afford them. He has also watched the street change around him. â€œIn the early days it was brilliant, simple. You said good morning to your neighbours, they said good morning to you. Then it got that if you said hello, people would give you a funny look.â€? The Power Station project, he says, has meant the people in the street talk to one another once more. â€œThis is what we want, the community spirit,â€? he says. â€œIt costs nothing to look after one another.â€?</p> <p>The collective nature of the scheme has been a draw for many of the residents. â€œWe all have concerns about the environment,â€? says Chris Humphreys, 49, who works in education and lives with his wife, Catherine, and their two sons. â€œAnd you try and do your little thing, but to be part of something bigger is very appealing. You see whatâ€™s happening in the news at the moment and you know it wonâ€™t be those people who make changes for the better. Itâ€™s got to start at the grassroots.

It consists largely of redbrick Victorian terraces. There are similar streets throughout the area, in Walthamstow, northeast London. Some houses are pebble-dashed. Some have doors painted in contemporary grey. There are wind chimes, geraniums in boxes, wheelie bins and the occasional cat sitting on a gate post. The only unusual feature is the number of windows displaying an A4 poster with the words â€œPower Stationâ€? printed in the font used by polling stations. Power, in the sense of the energy, is at the forefront of everyoneâ€™s mind. Energy bills have reached record highs and are still rising, with the war in Ukraine highlighting how fragile energy supplies can be. This yearâ€™s Cop27 climate conference promised money to poorer countries to assist with damage caused by climate change, yet no agreement was reached on phasing out fossil fuels. The idea of cleaner power, generated closer to home, should feel like an obvious goal. But, at the moment, there are no large-scale programmes dedicated to making it happen. Instead, there are people like Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell. These two are on the roof of their house, sitting on a bed they have just assembled. It is made up with a knitted blanket, bright sheets and a cheap foam mattress that is plastic-wrapped against the elements. Facing one way you can see their narrow back garden that ends when it hits the railway embankment. Turn around and you look down into their street, Lynmouth Road, which Dan and Hilary want to turn into a solar power station. They are living on their roof as a crowdfunder for the project. â€œI think it will be fine,â€? says Hilary, who has been scanning both the sky and the weather forecast. â€œI only get scared when the children say they want to come up, then I turn to jelly.â€? The couple are artists and filmmakers. They live in the middle of the street, with their children, EsmÃ©, 12, and George, 10, and the familyâ€™s two dogs. â€œIt is a street that has a sense of community,â€? says Hilary, down from the roof and sitting at their kitchen table. â€œThat became apparent with the Covid mutual aid group that was set up.â€? And it was during lockdown that a sentence from economist Ann Pettiforâ€™s book, The Case for the Green New Deal, which makes a strong argument for total decarbonisation and a financial system based on fairness, struck both of them. The phrase was: â€œEvery building a power station.â€? â€œWe clung on to that,â€? says Hilary. There was also Peopleâ€™s Power by American writer Ashley Dawson. â€œHe wrote about energy democracy and tackling the power monopolies within the energy industry,â€? she adds. The idea started to take shape. Could they make a home into a power station? And not just their home, but perhaps their whole street by linking the houses together into a grid? Buying and installing a solar system for an average three-bedroom house costs around Â£10,000, they discovered. Linking them together would be hard â€“ the technology is complex, especially in an urban area with lots of individual buildings. They did more research. And then they started talking to neighbours. â€œWell, if someone came and said there was a way of helping with the bills, youâ€™d be over the moon, wouldnâ€™t you?â€? says Ejaz Hussain, 71, now retired. â€œIf it comes off, Iâ€™ll know that Iâ€™ve been blessed.â€? Sipke Visser, 45, is a photographer and retoucher. He lives with his wife, their two children and his father-in-law. â€œI know Dan and Hilary, so I wasnâ€™t that surprised,â€? he says, â€œBut I do think if a complete stranger were to knock on my door, I would be very sceptical.â€? â€œWe looked at putting solar panels up quite a few years ago and we found the cost of doing it was too much,â€? says Pippa Evans, 57, who works at an adoption and fostering therapeutic agency. â€œSo I was intrigued when this flyer came through the letterbox. I wanted to know how it was going to work and if we could afford it. Were Dan and Hilary going to coordinate everything? I knew about their previous project. So I knew they were quite good at making things happen.â€? The previous project was Bank Job. In 2018, the couple started working in an empty building, a former bank on one of Walthamstowâ€™s main streets. They printed artwork that looked like bank notes, complete with pictures of people from local community projects, and sold them, raising Â£40,000 in the process. Half the money went back to the local groups. And with the remaining Â£20,000 they bought up Â£1.2m worth of high-interest debt owed by people in the local community. â€œYou can buy it for so much less because the assumption is that it wonâ€™t be paid off,â€? says Dan. They let the debtors know there was nothing left to pay, although GDPR rules meant this could only be done by sending letters via a debt broker. Then they packed up the paper records into a gold-coloured van and blew the whole thing up on wasteland outside Canary Wharf, the towers of the UKâ€™s financial sector looming in the background. The documentary they made about the project came out in 2021 and the remains of the van are currently on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. They describe Power Station as a natural evolution. â€œItâ€™s also a show-and-do project,â€? says Dan. â€œWeâ€™re learning as we go and weâ€™re sharing it as we learn it.â€? â€œWeâ€™re not setting ourselves up as experts,â€? adds Hilary. â€œThere isnâ€™t just one solution and we donâ€™t know everything about kilowatts per hour, so weâ€™re a conduit. Weâ€™re learning and educating ourselves and others and then also building partnerships with people who are experts.â€? Their own expertise, they say, is in making a project come to life and then drawing attention to the issues using art and storytelling. As of 2019 there were around 300 community energy projects in the UK covering 67,000 homes, according to the thinktank Green Alliance. The sector was hit when the governmentâ€™s community energy strategy was scrapped, with at least 66 projects folding in 2017 and more becoming precarious. The initial grand design for Lynmouth Road was for an entire street interlinked, powered for free and managed by a cooperative. But the mixture of rented and private, leasehold and freehold, and various mortgages with various banks meant dropping uniform infrastructure across the rooftops would be almost impossible. â€œIt turns out that not many people fully own their roof,â€? says Dan. While the whole street canâ€™t be linked now, Dan harbours a dream of making this happen as the project grows and would love to see a community battery so that those who canâ€™t have solar panels could also access power. And with 30 households involved â€“ nearly half the residencies in Lynmouth Road â€“ there is enough for the street to become a solar energy hotspot and model for what other streets could also achieve in terms of renewable power. The project, as it stands, will be funded in various ways. There are grants from organisations, such as the London Community Energy Fund. Thereâ€™s the crowdfunder, running while Dan and Hilary sleep on top of their house. They have also printed a new run of bank notes to sell, the notes and large handprinting machines currently occupying half of their living room. Buying solar equipment in bulk brings the price down, so participating residents can offer to pay, but the scheme is free for those who need it to be. Each resident will be given a grant for their solar installation and deal with the company directly. As we sit on the bed on the roof, the surveyor from the solar company is finishing his assessments. He climbs the scaffolding at the back of the house to come and chat, although he doesnâ€™t make it all the way up. â€œItâ€™s a bit ironic, in my line of work, but Iâ€™m not great with heights,â€? he says. Not everyone in the street has wanted or been able to take part. â€œSome people just shut the door before we started speaking,â€? says Dan. â€œThen there were people who were dying or divorcing or moving. Or having a loft conversion.â€? Loft conversions came up a lot. They can make rooftops unsuitable for solar panels, but the more frequent issue was that of imminent building work. Andy Richford, 70, is one of the people planning a loft conversion. An editorial consultant working in scientific publishing and with a background in ecology, he believes the project will amplify a necessary message. â€œIâ€™ve been banging on about it for years,â€? he says. â€œI might not be able to participate in terms of getting the panels, but making a difference is important to me. Putting solar panels on top of houses, with a direct feed into the house, means energy isnâ€™t lost in transmission and we donâ€™t have the worry of covering acres and acres of farmland or wild land.â€? The ground on which Lynmouth Road stands was once part of the marshland on the banks of the River Lea. The remaining marsh is less than half a mile away, some of it a Site of Special Scientific Interest and all of it popular with picnickers, dog walkers, runners and the occasional raver. The Lynmouth Road area, says Hilary, who has been looking into its history, was a watercress farm until the houses started going up in 1886. The Victorian era was Walthamstowâ€™s first growth spurt. Boosted by new rail links, the land filled up with houses for workers. It remained a largely working-class area for most of the 20th century, but in the 2000s house prices accelerated andWalthamstow, with its garden terraces, good schools and decent transport links, became a prime location. Between 2012 and 2019, house prices more than doubled. â€œIt used to be full of very long-term residents,â€? says Hilary. â€œOne family staying in a house for decades. We moved in around 14 years ago and found a newspaper from 1945.â€? Dan also mentions a former resident, Dorothy Burroughs, who spent her 100 years living on the street, only leaving to briefly enter a care home before her death last year. Dorothy remembered when electricity first came to the houses in the 1930s. â€œShe said that people needed to be shown what to do and how to use appliances. People would come round and demonstrate.â€? Ejaz Hussain has lived here since 1978. He has worked all of his adult life, including 20 years at a local food processing factory, now demolished to make way for flats. â€œIâ€™m struggling, although the mortgage is paid. Iâ€™ve got two daughters, one at college, one about to go to university. We put them first. But the bills come in and the house needs repairs and Iâ€™m on my pension,â€? he says. Like many of his neighbours, he had also looked at solar panels, but had been unable to afford them. He has also watched the street change around him. â€œIn the early days it was brilliant, simple. You said good morning to your neighbours, they said good morning to you. Then it got that if you said hello, people would give you a funny look.â€? The Power Station project, he says, has meant the people in the street talk to one another once more. â€œThis is what we want, the community spirit,â€? he says. â€œIt costs nothing to look after one another.â€? The collective nature of the scheme has been a draw for many of the residents. â€œWe all have concerns about the environment,â€? says Chris Humphreys, 49, who works in education and lives with his wife, Catherine, and their two sons. â€œAnd you try and do your little thing, but to be part of something bigger is very appealing. You see whatâ€™s happening in the news at the moment and you know it wonâ€™t be those people who make changes for the better. Itâ€™s got to start at the grassroots. Iâ€™ve never been especially active politically, but Iâ€™m very happy to stand alongside our neighbours in what I think is hopefully a practical and positive solution.â€? â€œI want to be part of the solution, even if itâ€™s just a small part,â€? says Dee Tweedie, 48, who has been involved with the project from the beginning and went door-to-door with Dan and Hilary to explain the idea. â€œWe all want to save the planet and the prices of everything are rising in tandemâ€¦ energy, food, mortgage.

The Chernobyl reactor used graphite to keep the nuclear reaction under control and the disaster was caused by a graphite fire. The Zaporizhzhia plant â€“ and those at <a href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/ukraine.aspx\">Ukraineâ€™s other main plants</a>, Khmelnitski, Rovno and South Ukraine â€“ has pressurised water reactors, a more modern type that do not involve graphite. So a fire such as the one at Chernobyl will not occur.</p> \n<p>Pressurised water reactors have a steel vessel at their centre, like a giant pressure cooker with 20cm-thick walls. This contains the nuclear fuel and radioactive products from the nuclear reaction and is designed to withstand damage from events such as earthquakes and aeroplane crashes, although not specifically artillery shells. The inner vessel is surrounded by a heavily steel reinforced concrete containment building â€“ Chernobyl did not have this.</p> \n<p>For a Chernobyl-level event, both the pressure vessel and concrete bioshield would need to be breached and this would probably require intentional targeting with huge explosives.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"98165763-046a-460f-8dd2-45e6905e34f0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u9qSK90s-B0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nevertheless, there is deep concern that any attack aimed at taking control of a facility could still lead to a nuclear incident. Experts are especially alarmed that an internationally recognised principle â€“ ensuring the physical integrity of civil nuclear plants â€“ has been disregarded.</p> \n<p>â€œItâ€™s very clear that this is against the Geneva conventions,â€? said Scott. â€œIt is a flagrant breach of international laws and agreements to do this.â€?</p> \n<p>Grossi, who says the situation â€œcontinues to be extremely tense and challengingâ€?, said on Friday that he had offered to travel to the Chernobyl site to facilitate a negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, with the aim of agreeing a framework to guarantee the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict.</p> \n<p>A concerning worst-case scenario, Scott said, was damage to the cooling capability at Zaporizhzhia or one of Ukraineâ€™s other facilities.</p> \n<p>Even after reactors are switched off, they need continual cooling for several weeks in order to remove residual heat from the core. The cooling systems rely on diesel generators, so any damage to these â€“ or if fuel was siphoned off for other purposes â€“ could cause an incident similar to that at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/03/was-fallout-from-fukushima-exaggerated\">Fukushima</a>, where the plantâ€™s power failed after a tsunami. That could result in the reactors overheating and residual water turning into steam, which could melt the fuel inside the reactor and cause the release of radiation into the atmosphere.</p> \n<p>There is also a concern about spent fuel storage facilities being disturbed. After fuel is taken out of a reactor core, it is put into spent pool ponds for a year or more to physically cool down before being transferred to long-term, more secure storage.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"2","wordcount":"667","firstPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T14:07:46Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2022-03-04T21:05:08Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2022-03-05T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/kqpxd","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c42d746b3be8d7337ba21326f5e35dff6a4be1d/0_0_4096_2458/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"The attack of Ukraineâ€™s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant â€“ Europeâ€™s largest â€“ has triggered international concern about the safety of the countryâ€™s facilities.

For now, say experts, the immediate danger from the attack appears to be low, with Russia having as much to lose as anyone. â€œIf thereâ€™s going to be a major nuclear incident itâ€™s because something deliberately is being done,â€? said Tom Scott, professor in materials at the University of Bristol. â€œSurely nobody is going to be that stupid. It doesnâ€™t benefit anyone. The wind is blowing towards Russia at the moment.â€? Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the IAEA UN nuclear watchdog, confirmed on Friday that radiation levels at the site had remained normal, that all safety systems at the plant were unaffected and that the reactors themselves had not been breached. The projectile had hit an administrative building some distance away within the site. Of the six reactors at the site, five are in safety mode, with one unit operating at 60% capacity. Reports from the site suggest that staff have continued to control operations. While Zelenskiy was quick to highlight the potential for a Chernobyl-scale incident, the technology at Zaporizhzhia is quite different. The Chernobyl reactor used graphite to keep the nuclear reaction under control and the disaster was caused by a graphite fire. The Zaporizhzhia plant â€“ and those at Ukraineâ€™s other main plants, Khmelnitski, Rovno and South Ukraine â€“ has pressurised water reactors, a more modern type that do not involve graphite. So a fire such as the one at Chernobyl will not occur. Pressurised water reactors have a steel vessel at their centre, like a giant pressure cooker with 20cm-thick walls. This contains the nuclear fuel and radioactive products from the nuclear reaction and is designed to withstand damage from events such as earthquakes and aeroplane crashes, although not specifically artillery shells. The inner vessel is surrounded by a heavily steel reinforced concrete containment building â€“ Chernobyl did not have this. For a Chernobyl-level event, both the pressure vessel and concrete bioshield would need to be breached and this would probably require intentional targeting with huge explosives. Nevertheless, there is deep concern that any attack aimed at taking control of a facility could still lead to a nuclear incident. Experts are especially alarmed that an internationally recognised principle â€“ ensuring the physical integrity of civil nuclear plants â€“ has been disregarded. â€œItâ€™s very clear that this is against the Geneva conventions,â€? said Scott. â€œIt is a flagrant breach of international laws and agreements to do this.â€? Grossi, who says the situation â€œcontinues to be extremely tense and challengingâ€?, said on Friday that he had offered to travel to the Chernobyl site to facilitate a negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, with the aim of agreeing a framework to guarantee the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict. A concerning worst-case scenario, Scott said, was damage to the cooling capability at Zaporizhzhia or one of Ukraineâ€™s other facilities. Even after reactors are switched off, they need continual cooling for several weeks in order to remove residual heat from the core. The cooling systems rely on diesel generators, so any damage to these â€“ or if fuel was siphoned off for other purposes â€“ could cause an incident similar to that at Fukushima, where the plantâ€™s power failed after a tsunami. That could result in the reactors overheating and residual water turning into steam, which could melt the fuel inside the reactor and cause the release of radiation into the atmosphere. There is also a concern about spent fuel storage facilities being disturbed. After fuel is taken out of a reactor core, it is put into spent pool ponds for a year or more to physically cool down before being transferred to long-term, more secure storage.","charCount":"4172","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/hannah-devlin\">Hannah Devlin</a> Science correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/mar/29/julius-caesar-review-rsc-stratford-upon-avon","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T13:53:09Z","webTitle":"Julius Caesar review â€“ timeless account of the flimsiness of power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/29/julius-caesar-review-rsc-stratford-upon-avon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/mar/29/julius-caesar-review-rsc-stratford-upon-avon","fields":{"headline":"Julius Caesar review â€“ timeless account of the flimsiness of power","standfirst":"<p><strong>Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon<br></strong>Atri Banerjeeâ€™s RSC production stresses the remarkable universality of the playâ€™s examination of leaders and the led</p>","trailText":"Atri Banerjeeâ€™s RSC production stresses the remarkable universality of the playâ€™s examination of leaders and the led","byline":"Mark Lawson","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"886ad6594f1ce8510f8282b2cb5b8b09a778e65e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/886ad6594f1ce8510f8282b2cb5b8b09a778e65e/0_113_3667_2201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"â€˜Reflections on crowds and powerâ€™ â€¦ Julius Caesar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eternal truths â€¦ Annabel Baldwin (Soothsayer) and Joshua Dunn (Cinna the Poet) in Julius Caesar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Early in the Trump administration, there was controversy over a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/18/donald-trump-julius-caesar-shakespeare-theater-abuse\">New York staging of Julius Caesar</a> in which the actor playing the slain tyrant resembled the 45th president.

The treaty came into force in 2011 and was extended in 2021 for five more years. It caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy, and the deployment of land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them. The two countries, which during the cold war were constrained by a tangle of arms control agreements, still account together for about 90% of the worldâ€™s nuclear warheads. Washington has been keen to preserve the treaty but ties with Moscow are the worst in decades over Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, an element that could complicate attempts by Joe Bidenâ€™s administration to maintain and reach a follow-on agreement. â€œRussiaâ€™s refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of US-Russian nuclear arms control,â€? a state department spokesperson said in emailed comments. Moscow in August suspended cooperation with inspections under the treaty, blaming travel restrictions imposed by Washington and its allies after Russian forces invaded neighbor Ukraine in February last year, but said it was still committed to complying with the provisions of the treaty. The state department spokesperson added that Russia had a â€œclear pathâ€? for returning to compliance by allowing inspection activities, and that Washington remains ready to work with Russia to fully implement the treaty. â€œThe New Start treaty remains in the national security interests of the United States,â€? the spokesperson said. Talks between Moscow and Washington on resuming inspections under New Start were due to take place in November in Egypt, but Russia postponed them, accusing the United States of â€œtoxicity and animosityâ€?, and neither side has set a new date. On Monday, Russia told the United States that the treaty could expire in 2026 without a replacement because it said Washington was trying to inflict â€œstrategic defeatâ€? on Moscow in Ukraine. Asked if Moscow could envisage there being no nuclear arms control treaty after 2026, deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told the RIA state new agency: â€œThis is quite a possible scenario.â€? The United States has supplied more than $27bn in security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion, including more than 1,600 Stinger anti-aircraft rocket systems, 8,500 Javelin anti-tank missile systems and 1m 155mm artillery rounds. Russian president Vladimir Putin has issued thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, reviving cold war era fears of an apocalyptic war. Shortly after taking office, Biden extended New Start by five years until 2026, giving time to negotiate while preserving what the Democratic administration sees as an important existing treaty. The previous administration of Donald Trump had ripped up previous arms control agreements and had been hesitant to preserve New Start in its current form, saying that any nuclear treaty must also include China, whose arsenal is rapidly growing but still significantly below those of Russia and the United States.","charCount":"3307","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"Staff and agencies in Washington","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/15/climate-activists-must-target-power-structures-not-the-public","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T16:56:20Z","webTitle":"Climate activists must target power structures, not the public | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/15/climate-activists-must-target-power-structures-not-the-public","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/15/climate-activists-must-target-power-structures-not-the-public","fields":{"headline":"Climate activists must target power structures, not the public","standfirst":"<p><strong>Dr Laura Thomas-Walters,</strong> <strong>Tim Williamson</strong> and <strong>Paul Chandler</strong> respond to Jack Shenkerâ€™s article that asked if the disruptive tactics of groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil are working</p>","trailText":"Letters:<strong> Dr Laura Thomas-Walters,</strong> <strong>Tim Williamson</strong> and <strong>Paul Chandler</strong> respond to Jack Shenkerâ€™s article which asked if the disruptive tactics of groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil are working","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"001e330f46425063091bbe4723e0674bc0b7f179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001e330f46425063091bbe4723e0674bc0b7f179/6_197_6406_3844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"â€˜Despite what we may like to believe, in a democracy, public opinion is only one small influence on the government.â€™\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">â€˜Despite what we may like to believe, in a democracy, public opinion is only one small influence on the government.â€™</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>I am an environmental social scientist and climate activist.

Amid deep divisions among senior Conservatives, the strategy will enrage environmentalists, who say the governmentâ€™s plans are in defiance of its own net-zero targets and neglect alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills. The prime minister will launch the plan on Thursday, after a period of intense political wrangling set against the backdrop of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, which has convulsed energy markets and sent home energy bills rocketing.

The cabinet eventually agreed that atomic energy would form the backbone of the strategy, and up to eight new reactors are planned. Targets for offshore wind and solar power generation will also be raised, in a push for 95% of Great Britainâ€™s electricity to come from domestic low-carbon energy sources by 2030.

The energy strategy outlines a wide-ranging plan to boost domestic energy production through a range of power sources. They include: Increasing nuclear capacity from 7 gigawatts to 24GW Offshore wind target raised from 40GW to 50GW (from 11GW today) Solar could grow five times from 14GW to 70GW by 2035 An â€œimpartialâ€? review into whether fracking is safe Up to 10GW of hydrogen power by 2030 Johnson said the plan will â€œreduce our dependence on power sources exposed to volatile international prices we cannot control, so we can enjoy greater energy self-sufficiency with cheaper billsâ€?. â€œThis plan comes in light of rising global energy prices, provoked by surging demand after the pandemic as well as Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. â€œThis will be central to weaning Britain off expensive fossil fuels, which are subject to volatile gas prices set by international markets we are unable to control, and boosting our diverse sources of homegrown energy for greater energy security in the long term.â€? While some renewable domestic energy sources won backing, the wind industryâ€™s hopes of getting the green light to double onshore capacity to 30GW appeared to have fallen victim to opposition from within the Conservative party to new projects, particularly in England. Communities who live near planned new projects could be offered incentives, such as guaranteed lower energy bills, but the plan does not include targets for increased generation. Cabinet colleagues have been at odds over whether to reform planning laws to spur faster development of onshore windfarms, which can take as little as a year to build and start contributing to the grid, but were described by transport secretary Grant Shapps as an â€œeyesoreâ€? at the weekend. Shapps and chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris, a longstanding opponent of onshore wind, are among a group of MPs who have sought to thwart a major rollout in England, with Michael Gove and business minister Kwasi Kwarteng â€“ whose brief includes energy â€“ among those to have pushed back. The business department is also understood to have been thwarted by the Treasury in a plan to channel Â£300m of budget underspend into a rapid rollout of energy efficiency upgrades that could aid homeowners in bringing down their bills. Solar won significant backing from the government, which said planning rules could be relaxed to favour development on non-protected land, enabling capacity to increase up to fivefold, from 14GW to 70GW. The target for hydrogen power will be doubled to 10GW by 2030 â€œsubject to affordability and value for moneyâ€?. Overall, â€œcleanâ€? energy sources could provide up to 40,000 new jobs, reaching a total of 480,000 by 2030, the government will say. But alongside the push for renewables sit plans that will alarm opponents of further oil and gas exploitation. The British Geological Survey will conduct an â€œimpartialâ€? review of whether fracking for shale gas can proceed safely, a move likely to spark fury among environmental campaigners about the controversial technology, particularly after a moratorium was imposed on the process in 2019. New North Sea oil and gas projects are also likely to be accelerated, although the strategy sets out proposals to limit emissions as much as possible. Nuclear power forms the centrepiece of the energy strategy. Ministers expect to begin a competitive selection process as early as next year for a new round of nuclear projects, although tensions between Downing Street and the Treasury over the cost of new projects, which are expected to require government investment, have yet to be resolved. The target of producing 25% of Britainâ€™s electricity from atomic energy is likely to require tens of billions of pounds of new investment from private companies, with the state providing guarantees under a new â€œregulated asset baseâ€? funding model. A Â£120m â€œFuture Nuclear Enabling Fundâ€? will be launched this month in the hope of kickstarting projects, while a new body called Great British Nuclear will oversee the plans. National Grid has predicted that peak electricity demand will hit 85GW by 2050, up from 60GW today, because of factors such as the electrification of vehicles and home heating. The government said it could approve up to eight new reactors to help reach a target of generating 24GW of the total from nuclear power plants, which typically have more than one reactor. Some of the increase can be achieved by extending the life of the Sizewell B reactor, while the Hinkley Point C project is due for completion in 2027 and Rolls-Royce has the governmentâ€™s blessing for small reactors nicknamed â€œmini-nukesâ€?. Major projects that have already been through some form of planning, such as Sizewell C and Wylfa, on Anglesey, have been singled out by the government as among the first to win support. The target also implies new plants at sites whose locations have already been approved but where no plans are under way, such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire or Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria. While Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine has prompted global discussion on how to reduce reliance on Kremlin-controlled oil and gas, it appears to have cooled the governmentâ€™s resolve to limit the UKâ€™s own fossil fuel production. Drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea is at odds with the governmentâ€™s own net-zero targets. The government will justify the plans by saying that local exploitation of hydrocarbons emits less carbon than importing supplies from elsewhere. Ministers have also commissioned a new study to examine safety concerns about fracking, which polls have shown is deeply unpopular with the public. â€¢ This article was amended on 7 April 2022.

Senior nuclear industry figures said the reclassification would help attract investors to fund the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, which the government has committed Â£700m towards. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, called the move a â€œhuge step forward for UK energy security and net zeroâ€?. But Stuart Murphy, founder of tidal energy specialist TPGen24, said: â€œThere is nothing environmentally sustainable about a finite resource which leaves a legacy of hazardous waste.â€? Britainâ€™s energy industry has been under the spotlight since the war in Ukraine pushed already-high oil and gas prices higher. On Wednesday, Hunt confirmed a widely expected U-turn in on a planned cut to energy support for households. He also said that from July, 4m households on prepayment meters will see their bills aligned with those on direct debits, who currently pay less. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said it expected to see taxes brought in from oil and gas firms for 2022-23 quadruple on last year to Â£11bn, representing just a fifth of the Â£55bn in annual global profits of British energy giants BP and Shell. The government introduced a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators last May. The OBR said falling wholesale gas prices meant it had cut its forecasts by Â£4bn this year, and Â£10bn next year, compared with forecasts made in November. The OBR also said it expects the bailout of Bulb to cost a further Â£3bn â€œbut much of that cost is ultimately likely to be recoupedâ€? over an uncertain timeframe following the sale of the bust energy supplier to Octopus Energy.","charCount":"3482","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/alex-lawson\">Alex Lawson</a> Energy correspondent","showTableOfContents":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T18:20:57Z","webTitle":"Shelling of Zaporizhzhia is playing with fire, says UN nuclear chief, as blasts reported","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Shelling of Zaporizhzhia is playing with fire, says UN nuclear chief, as blasts reported","standfirst":"<p>Explosions cause damage at Ukrainian power plant, as Kyiv says it will investigate videos allegedly of surrendering Russians being shot</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/ukraine-live/latest\">Russia-Ukraine war â€“ latest updates</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Explosions cause damage at Ukrainian power plant, as Kyiv says it will investigate videos allegedly of surrendering Russians being shot","byline":"Jennifer Rankin","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4db83f9cacd94bfdf2723cb96b708c2e4ce8ac3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4db83f9cacd94bfdf2723cb96b708c2e4ce8ac3d/156_0_6448_3869/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as seen from Nikopol, Ukraine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The UN nuclear energy watchdog has said the forces behind the shelling of Ukraineâ€™s Zaporizhzhia power plant are â€œplaying with fireâ€?, after a series of explosions shook the facility.</p> <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has experts based at Zaporizhzhia, reported on Sunday that powerful explosions had shaken the area on Saturday night and Sunday.
